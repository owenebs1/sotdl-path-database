One can usually spot a witch right away, as they favor a peculiar form of dress. All witches, regardless of gender, favor dark clothing of homespun, long cloaks, sturdy boots, and tall, pointed hats. Though the individual cut and style might vary from witch to witch, the hat never does. This unique headgear identifies witches to others, and ensures that only fools cross them. Witches use wands, pentacles made from wood, paper, or bronze, or blades such as daggers and swords as implements.
Witches add to their numbers only with great care and caution. Their primary charge is the protection of the ancient lore of their kind, and so offering instruction to someone not known to them is unthinkable. All witches understand they must pass on their learning eventually, and so they begin the search for apprentices early in their careers.
The qualities a witch looks for in an apprentice include a knack for magic, intelligence, honesty, humility, patience—and above all, common sense.
Sometimes these traits are found in people within a witch’s community. Sometimes a would-be apprentice will search for a witch to train under. A witch can never be bullied into revealing her secrets, though, and many who seek out an apprenticeship are turned away, their eagerness betraying some flaw or dark intent.
The first lesson an apprentice learns is humility, for an apprentice might labor for years before discovering his or her first tradition. Apprentices cook, clean, mend clothes, help with the birthing of children, and learn the names and lives of all the people in their community.
During this time, the witch instructor watches for flaws in the student, needing to ensure that he or she can be trusted with the lore of witchcraft. Many apprentices never learn magic, finding themselves unequal to the expectations placed on them. The few who are found worthy are ushered into the deeper mysteries of the faith.
After a student has learned the basics, he or she is initiated into the faith, typically during the next new moon. The initiation ceremony varies from witch to witch, but it often involves degrees of testing, anointment with oils, the casting of spells, and the offering of prayers to the Lord and Lady. Only after undergoing initiation is an apprentice witch recognized as a member of the faith. Even then, apprentices must work to earn the right to call themselves witches, a title they gain only when their peers accept them.
### Tenets and Strictures
Much of the lore that witches keep safe involves helping others, so it follows that witches devote their lives to service—and often for little or no thanks. Witches must always use their talents in the aid of others, seeking to uplift, to guide, and to improve. They must avoid forcing their views onto non-witches, in favor of guiding when asked and leading by example. Witches are forbidden from using magic to increase their wealth, to compel others to do their bidding (except in the defense of those they have chosen to protect), and to always avoid dark magic. Failure to live by these tenets leads to corruption.
