Unlike the other Old Faith gods, the Seer has no extensive network of priests and no religious hierarchy.
Instead, the god chooses certain mortals through which he might speak. The Seer’s priests are called sibyls, and in their capacity as servants of the god, they foretell the future and answer questions put to them after gaining wisdom from their patron. Most sibyls ensconce themselves in the small temples of the Seer found across the Empire, where they rely on their attendants for protection, food, and companionship. A rare few move freely throughout the land, most often because they have not yet found a temple in which they might dwell, or because their former temples were destroyed.
Priests of the Seer must never lie. They feel compelled to speak the truth, even when doing so would cause trouble or put them in danger. However, the sibyls are also wise enough to omit certain details of their foretelling if doing so would not distort the truth in any way.
Most priests of the Seer wear loose, comfortable robes of white cloth. They use the symbols of their god as implements, and bind their eyes with a strip of cloth on which the Seer’s eye has been painted. Even when covered this way, though, a sibyl can still see as normal.
Dedicated priests of the seer might become oracles, witches, or psychics.
