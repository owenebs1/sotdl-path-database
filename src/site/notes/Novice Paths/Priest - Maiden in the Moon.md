For some two thousand years, it was customary for families to off er their firstborn daughters to the cult of the Maiden in the Moon. Though the cult did not always accept this offer—usually because their numbers were large enough, or the offered child had no talent for magic—being selected was considered a great honor.
However, those old customs died out with the rise of other religions, so the cult now refreshes its numbers by gathering female orphans and bringing them up in the mysteries of their faith. Those who pass initiation join the Daughters of the Moon.
The goddess expects her servants to seek out and keep safe the secrets of magical power, to advance their own understanding of those secrets, and to fight against any who delve into the depths of dark magic. Her priests also study the heavens, searching for signs of things to come.
The goddess forbids her followers from learning or using dark magic, and those who do are maimed and exiled.
Though most priests of the maiden cloister in temples to study, some venture out into the world beyond to seek new magic and discover new knowledge—especially knowledge that relates to magic. The Daughters of the Moon also keep a careful watch for young women who display inner power, encouraging them to further their studies under the maiden’s guidance.
During religious ceremonies, Daughters of the Moon wear diaphanous gowns in blue and gray silk. They paint their faces with stars and moons, wearing silver jewelry for the favor shown that metal by the goddess. Most priests tattoo crescent moons on their foreheads or cheeks. Tattooed stars are also common along the arms and legs. Priests can use any objects as implements, though most favor wands. The most devoted followers of the maiden go on to become sorcerers, wizards,
or sages.
