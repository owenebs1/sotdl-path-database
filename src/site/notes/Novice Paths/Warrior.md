Extensive training with weapons and studying numerous fighting styles teach warriors how to fight and survive on the battlefield. Their skills depend on being physically fit, quick and nimble, or a combination of both. Upon completing their training, warriors can pick up and fight with almost any weapon, striking with greater precision and greater force than anyone else.
Although all warriors know how to fight, they distinguish themselves by the weapons they wield. Some favor archery and put their focus on ranged weapons. Others fight with swords and axes, using their might to overcome their foes.
Others still favor swift weapons, slipping rapier or saber strikes through their enemies’ defenses.
Warriors come from all backgrounds. They are howling barbarians tumbling out from the depth of the wilderness, veteran soldiers marching in the Empire’s armies, hard-bitten mercenaries, mystics who transform their bodies into weapons, or anyone else who knows how to win battles through superior skill at arms.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | You fought in the pits and arenas of your homeland. Each contest honed your talent until you became an experienced warrior.                                                                |
| 2   | You spent time in service to a knight as a squire. You learned how to fight, ride, care for your gear, and conduct yourself in a proper and noble manner.                                  |
| 3   | You were a soldier, a member of the militia, or part of the watch. You learned basic combat techniques and discovered you had a talent for fighting.                                       |
| 4   | You lived on civilization’s edges. The hardships you endured and dangers you faced taught you how to survive.                                                                              |
| 5   | You learned to fight while living on the streets. You might have been a thug, taking what you wanted by brute force, an enforcer for a crime family, or a bodyguard for someone important. |
| 6   | You learned the fighting techniques from a master warrior. You might have studied at a monastery or sought out a teacher in a far-flung land.                                              |
