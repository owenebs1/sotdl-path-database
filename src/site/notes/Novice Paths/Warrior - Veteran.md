The struggles and dangers you overcame drove home the idea that you have to fight to survive in this perilous world. You spent some time traveling, battling, and learning from your opponents. You likely gained a few scars along the way, having found yourself in tight spots, but you persevered and fought your way free, until you became the seasoned warrior you are today.
You have few illusions left about what it means to fight. You know what to do, and when the battle starts, you do your job and you do it well.
