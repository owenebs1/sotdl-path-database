Erudition provides scientists with all they need to tackle the challenges in their path. Grounded in secular theory and thought, rejecting the occult, scientists attack problems with a combination of cunning, learnedness, and determination to unravel the mysteries before them. The further they progress their training, the more they learn, and the greater the wonders they can create.
Scientists come from academic backgrounds, which help reflect their education and training in higher learning. Some, though, might have taught themselves, such as a criminal with ideas about building devices to carry out heists or soldiers who study engineering to build war machines. Scientists can even come from the ranks of the religious. They might commit themselves to serving the gods, but also see it as their duty to gain a better understanding of the world.
### Scientist Training

| d6  | Training                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You studied science at Lij’s Academy and dedicated your life to further advancing scientific studies.                                                                              |
| 2   | You were always brilliant. Where others find insurmountable obstacles, you see opportunities to exercise your brain power.                                                         |
| 3   | You were raised among clockworks and due to your fascination with them, dedicated your life to finding ways to create them without magic.                                          |
| 4   | You abhor magic. Your goal is to create devices anyone can use no matter their magical affinity or lack thereof.                                                                   |
| 5   | While sleeping under a clocktower you became consumed by an insistent ticking noise. After months of enduring the ticking, you found yourself knowing many scientific disciplines. |
| 6   | Your “science” is crude at best, but the results don’t lie. You might have learned your craft from peasants, goblins, or other sorts.                                              |

# Level 1 Scientist
**Attributes:** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics:** Health +3
**Languages and Professions:** You read and write all the languages you speak, and add one academic area of knowledge of your choice.
**Applied Academics:** When a creature within short range makes an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can use a triggered action to either grant 1 boon or impose 1 bane on the triggering roll. If you grant a boon to an attack roll and the total of the roll is 2o or higher, the creature deals an extra 2d6 damage.
**Recovered Secrets:** You can use an action to heal damage equal to your healing rate. Then, until the end of the round, each creature you choose within short range makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon. Once you use this talent, you cannot use it again until you complete a rest.

# The Sciences
Scientific innovation follows numerous routes and covers nearly every aspect of the physical and metaphysical world. The following sciences represent those most likely to be adopted by a scientist. Each time you gain a science from the scientist novice path, you can choose one science and gain one benefit for doing so. Each time you choose the same science after the first, you gain another benefit from it. Also, many benefits improve as your group attains higher levels.

## Botany
Botany reveals knowledge of plants and similar living organisms found in the world. Your study of Botany offers you ways to manipulate plants, fungi, slimes, and other things to serve your interests and needs.
When you choose this science, you gain an alchemy kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends. In addition, **each time you choose this science, gain one of the following benefits.**
### Defoliant
You discover a potent poison useful for clearing away plants and similar matter. When you complete a rest while you have an alchemist’s kit, you produce a number of doses of defoliant equal to 1 + half your level that retain potency until used or you complete another rest.
As an action, you can deploy the defoliant so that a 5-yard-radius cloud forms on a point you choose within medium range. The cloud obscures its area for 1 minute before dissipating. When the cloud appears, all normal plants and fungi in the cloud die and wither away.
Any creature with the fungus, ooze, or plant descriptor in the cloud when it appears or that enters it takes 3d6 damage and becomes diseased for as long as it remains in the cloud and for 1 minute thereafter.
At the end of each round such a creature has this affliction, it makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, takes 1d6 damage.
Finally, all other living creatures in the cloud when it appears or that enter it make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage and becomes diseased- until it moves out of the cloud.
At level 5, the cloud’s radius increases to 10 yards. At level 8, the cloud deals 5d6 damage to fungi, plants, and slimes, and 2d6 damage to all other creatures that get failures on their Strength rolls.
### Fertilizer
You concoct a strong fertilizer that makes plants grow at a rapid rate and gain unusual qualities. When you complete a rest while you have an alchemist’s kit, you can produce a number of doses of fertilizer equal to 1 + half your level. The doses retain potency until used or you complete another rest.
As an action, you can deploy the fertilizer onto a solid square-shaped surface, up to 5 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. If the surface contains no natural plants, molds, or fungus (in other words, it is bare earth, sand, or stone), plants grow across the surface until it becomes difficult terrain that remains for 24 hours or until burned away—10 damage from fire clears a square, 1 yard on each side, of difficult terrain. At level 5, the growth can be harvested, which takes 1 hour of work, and produces food for up to ten people. The food spoils after 24 hours. At level 8, you can choose to also produce one of the random fertilizer effects.
If the surface contains any plant of fungal matter, the fertilizer causes it to grow with unpredictable results. Roll a d6 and find the number rolled on the following table to see what happens. At level 8, you can choose another result in addition to the result gained from the roll of the die and apply its effect to the area.
#### Fertilizer Results

| Roll | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1–2  | For 1 minute, the plants reach for and curl around creatures on them in the affected area. When this effect begins, and again on each of your turns until the effect ends, each creature on the surface makes a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes immobilized until it uses an action to break free. If the creature is already immobilized, it takes 1d6 damage instead. At level 5, creatures take 1d6 damage when they become immobilized or take 2d6 damage if already immobilized.                          |
| 3–4  | Thorny growth erupts from the surface until it reaches a height of 3 yards or a solid surface. The growth provides total cover to anything behind it. Each creature in area when the thorns appear takes 1d6 damage, or 2d6 damage at level 5. In addition, when a creature enters the zone or moves inside of it, the creature takes 1 damage per yard moved if the creature moves more than 2 yards on its turn.                                                                                                                         |
| 5    | Flowers appear throughout the surface and release a cloud of poisonous pollen that obscures the air above the surface, up to a maximum height of 5 yards. Any living creature in the zone when the pollen appears or that enters it takes 1d6 damage and makes a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 extra damage, or 3d6 extra damage at level 5, and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature is also fatigued. If the creature is already poisoned, it takes 1d6 extra damage. |
| 6    | The plants form into a plant creature that uproots itself and takes a turn immediately. The plant creature is under your control and uses the statistics for a [[Bestiary/Monster, Small\|small monster]] (or [[Bestiary/Monster, Medium\|medium monster]] at level 5) that’s immune to the asleep, blinded, dazed, frightened, and stunned afflictions, but takes double damage from fire. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the plant becomes incapacitated.                                                                                          |
### Herbal Concoctions
You learn how to create special substances from herbs you find. When you complete a rest in a wilderness zone while you have an alchemist’s kit, you produce a number of herbal concoctions equal to 1 + half your level that retain potency until used or you complete another rest. For each herbal concoction you produce, choose one of the following options.
As an action, a creature holding the concoction can consume it or administer it to one creature within its reach. The concoction takes effect at the end of the round.
**Botanical Infusion:** The affected creature gains the plant descriptor for 1 minute (or 1 hour at level 5), with all of the following benefits.
- Increase its Defense by 2.
- Halve its Speed.
- Grant immunity to asleep, blinded, dazed, deafened, and stunned.
- Cause the creature to take double damage from fire.
- Enable the creature to use a move while on an earthen surface to root itself in place, which prevents it from being moved short of teleportation.
- Grant the creature’s melee weapon attacks the reach property if they don’t have it already.

**Herbal Remedy:** The creature heals damage equal to its healing rate, or twice its healing rate at level 5. In addition, the creature becomes immune to damage from disease for 24 hours after.

**Herbal Stimulant:** On the creature’s next turn, it can increase the number of actions it can use by one. At the end of the creature’s turn, the creature makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, the creature falls prone, becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and the effect ends. The effect ends immediately after 1 minute.
Starting at level 5, the affected creature makes the challenge roll with 1 boon
## Chemistry
In tackling chemistry, you explore the nature of substance and discover how the interactions of certain chemicals can produce useful, explosive results, or substances that enhance or befuddle the people around you.
When you choose this science, you gain an alchemy kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends. In addition, **each time you choose this science, gain one of the following benefits.**
### Corrosives and Poisons
You learn how to create dangerous substances from the chemicals contained in your alchemist’s kit.
When you complete a rest, you produce a number of substances equal to 1 + half your level. The substances retain potency until used or you complete a rest. For each substance, choose one of the following options.
If you have Demon Lord’s Companion, you can also choose all-flower water or superior glue.
**Chemical Acid:** Any creature holding the acid can use an action to pour it onto to a creature or object in reach or fling the acid at one creature or object within short range. A creature makes an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage from the acid, or 2d6 damage at level 5, plus 1 damage at the end of each round until a creature that can reach the target uses an action to wash off the corrosive. On a success, the creature takes 1d3 damage, or 1d6 damage at level 5.
**Chemical Drug:** Any creature holding the drug can use an action to consume it or administer it to a willing or unconscious creature in reach. The creature consuming the drug makes a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. A creature can choose to fail this roll. On a failure, the creature becomes poisoned for 1 hour.
While poisoned in this way, the first time the creature takes damage in a round, it reduces the amount of damage by 1d6, or 2d6 at level 5.
**Chemical Poison:** Chemical poison functions as ordinary poison (Shadow, page 107), except that a creature damaged by the poisoned weapon takes 1d6 damage from the poison, or 2d6 at level 5, and a creature consuming the poisoned food or drink takes 1d6 damage from the poison, or 3d6 at level 5.
### Explosives
As an action, you can set an explosive or throw it to a point within short range. When you complete a rest, you produce a number of explosives equal to 1 + half your level, which retain potency until used or you complete another rest.
As an action, you can set an explosive or throw it. At the end of the round, the explosive detonates and deals 3d6 damage to each creature and object in a 5-yard radius. At level 5, the damage increases to 5d6. A creature that would take this damage makes an Agility roll and takes half the damage instead on a success.
### Pharmaceuticals
You learn how to make special pharmaceuticals from chemicals contained in your alchemist’s kit. When you complete a rest, you produce a number of pharmaceuticals equal to 1 + half your level. The pharmaceuticals retain potency until used or you complete a rest.
Any creature holding a pharmaceutical can use an action to ingest it or administer it to a creature within reach. If the target is unwilling, the creature makes a Strength attack roll against the target’s Agility. If you use a syringe (see Shadow, page 108), the creature can use an action or a triggered action, on its turn, to administer the pharmaceutical.
**Health Booster:** The affected creature gains a +5 bonus to Health for 1 hour, or a +15 bonus at level 5.
**Strength Booster:** The affected creature makes Strength attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon and imposes 1 bane on rolls made against its Strength.
In addition, the creature’s melee attacks and ranged attacks using thrown weapons deal an extra 1d6 damage. The effect wears off after 1 minute, or 1 hour at level 5.
**Speed Booster:** The affected creature gains a +4 bonus to its Speed for 1 minute, or a +6 bonus at level 5.
When the creature takes a turn, it can make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a success, the creature increases the number of actions it can use on its turn by one. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage from strain.

## Entomology
You focus your studies on learning everything there is to know about insects and similar creatures. From your efforts, you discover how to control and make allies of these creatures. Furthermore, you might eventually discover advanced techniques that imbue your insect allies with even greater capabilities.
When you choose this science, you gain an alchemist’s kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends. In addition, **each time you choose this science, gain one of the following benefits.**
### Control Swarm
You keep a swarm of insects on your person. The swarm hides on your person, crawling over your body or lurking inside your alchemist kit. As an action, you call forth the swarm or call it back to you. If you are incapacitated by fire while you carry the swarm, you lose access to this benefit until you complete a rest.
While out of their container, you can use an action to give the swarm any of the following commands.
**Attack:** The swarm crawls or flies toward and attacks one creature of your choice within short range. The target makes an Agility challenge roll and takes 3d6 damage on a failure.
**Distract:** The swarm encircles one creature within short range until the creature becomes incapacitated, moves, or you give the swarm another command. While so encircled, the creature is impaired.
**Obscure:** The swarm spreads out to heavily obscure a cube of space, 5 yards on a side, originating from a point within short range. If the swarm’s area is included in an Air, Fire, Storm, or Water spell that would affect an area, the swarm disperses and reforms on you after 1 minute.
**Protect:** The swarm encircles you or one creature of your choice within short range and remains until the target moves or becomes incapacitated, or you give the swarm a new command. While encircling the target, the swarm imposes 1 bane on attack rolls made against the target.
**Monstrous Swarm:** At level 5, you can command the swarm to concentrate into a monstrous swarm for 1 minute. In this form, the swarm uses the statistics for an animal swarm with the flier trait. If the swarm becomes incapacitated, you lose this Control Swarm benefit for 1 hour.
### Giant Insects
You learn how to grow insects to enormous size from substances contained in your alchemist’s kit. When you complete a rest, you cause one normal insect you subject to your experiments to grow until it reaches the size of a tiny monster ([[Bestiary/Monster, Small\|small monster]] at level 5, [[Bestiary/Monster, Medium\|medium monster]] at level 8). The giant insect is under your control. It takes its turn when you do and you decide what it does on each of its turns. The giant insect returns to its normal size when you complete another rest or if it becomes incapacitated.
### Poison Spray
You harvest venom from the insects you study and concentrate it into a deadly spray. As an action, you release a spray at one creature within short range.
Make an Agility attack roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target takes 1d6 damage, or 2d6 damage at level 5, and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. If the target is already poisoned, it takes 1d6 extra damage. In addition, at the end of each round, a target poisoned in this way makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, takes 1d6 damage and becomes impaired until the end of the next round.
You can use poison spray a number of times equal to 1 + half your level. You regain expended uses after you complete a rest.
## Geology
The science of geology concerns itself with the earth.
You build contraptions to help move and control earth.
When you choose this science, you gain a tool kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends.
In addition, you gain a construct servant, which is a [[Bestiary/Construct, Small\|small construct]]. The servant is under your control, it takes its turn when you do, and you decide what it does on its turns. If your construct becomes incapacitated, it is destroyed. You can replace a destroyed construct at the end of the adventure.
The servant becomes a [[Bestiary/Construct, Medium\|medium construct]] if you choose this science twice or a [[Bestiary/Construct, Large\|large construct]] if you choose it a third time.
In addition to what the servant can normally do, you can use an action to give the construct any of the following commands provided you are within short range of it.
**Bulldoze:** At the end of each round, the construct moves loose earth, sand, and stone that can fit inside a cube of space of the construct’s size from one spot to another within short range of it.
**Dig:** The construct digs through a surface made of earth, sand, or stone within its reach until you use an action to command it to stop. The construct excavates a hole of its size into the surface in which it digs moving 1 foot of earth or sand or 1 inch of stone at the end of each round. Material it digs out of the surface falls to the ground behind it, creating difficult terrain that remains until cleared away. A construct’s digging could make structures unsafe, at the GM’s discretion, causing portions of a structure, such as walls, surfaces, and the like to collapse, potentially harming anything under them.
While the construct obeys the command, at the end of each minute it works (or hour if you have chosen this science three times), roll a d6. On a 3 or less, the construct takes 1d6 damage from its exertions.
**Thumper:** If the construct is on a surface on which it can stand, it strikes the ground at the end of each round, causing a wave to roll through that surface in a 5-yard radius centered on a point in its space.
The construct makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, takes 1d6 damage. Each other creature on the affected surface makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, takes 1d6 damage and falls prone. The damage increases to 2d6 if you have taken this science twice or 3d6 if you have taken it
three times.
## Metaphysics
Metaphysics explores the mysteries of space, time, and the underpinnings of reality. Your effort to understand this complex science gives you access to potent tools for taking control of your surroundings.
When you choose this science, you gain a tool kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends. **In addition, each time you choose this science, you gain one gadget of your choice.** If you lose one or more gadgets during an adventure, you can replace them if you have a tool kit and complete a rest.
### Gravity Coil
You have a gravity coil, which is an iron rod, four feet in length, with a six-inch copper ring fitted to either end. You can use the gravity coil to produce any of the following effects by expending a charge from it. The gadget has a number of charges equal to 1 + half your level and regains all expended charges 24 hours after the last charge has been expended.
**Gravity Pulse:** As an action, or as a triggered action when a creature within short range attacks you, you release a wave of gravity from the coil. Each unsecured object within short range of you moves 5 yards away from you. Each creature within short range of you makes a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature moves 5 yards away from you and, if the total of its roll is 0 or less, it falls prone.
**Low Gravity:** As an action, you reduce the gravity around you out to short range of the coil for 1 minute or until you use an action to end the effect. Any creature in the area doubles the distance it can jump and leap, and creatures take half the damage from landing on a surface in the area after a fall.
**Strong Gravity:** As an action, you increase the gravity around you out to short range of the coil for 1 minute or until you use an action to end the effect. Creatures treat surfaces in the area as difficult terrain, halve the range of their jumping and leaping distances, and take double damage from landing on a surface in the area after a fall. Finally, any flying creature that moves into the area makes a Strength challenge roll and, on a failure, falls unless it hovers.
### Lightning Dynamo
A lightning dynamo is a metal rod wrapped in copper wire and fitted to a nonconductive plate.
Straps attached to the plate allow it to be carried on one’s back. A cable extends out from the gadget and ends in a metal rod.
As an action, you can release lightning from the rod to streak toward one creature or object within short range by expending a charge from the gadget.
The gadget has a number of charges equal to 1 + half your level and regains all expended charges 24 hours after the last charge has been expended.
The target makes an Agility challenge roll and, on a failure, takes 3d6 damage. At level 5, the damage increases to 5d6 and 8d6 at level 8.
After you expend a charge from the gadget, roll a d6. On a 3 or less, electricity sparks from the dynamo, and each creature within your reach makes an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage.
### Wormhole Projector
A wormhole projector resembles an arquebus fitted with a row of glass bulbs that project from the barrel. As an action, you can attempt to open a wormhole that connects one cube of space, 1 yard on each side, to another of the same size at a destination you can see within medium range (long range at level 5, and extreme range at level 8) by expending a charge. The gadget has a number of charges equal to 1 + half your level and regains all expended charges 24 hours after the last charge has been expended. Make an Intellect challenge roll.
You make this roll with 1 bane for each time you use the gadget after the first. The number of banes resets to zero after you complete a rest.
On a success, a wormhole forms between the two spaces, allowing any creature or object entering one space to emerge instantly from the other. The wormhole remains until it destabilizes or you use an action to close it. At the end of each round the wormhole remains open, roll a d6. On a 3 or less, the wormhole destabilizes and disappears.
On a failure, nothing happens and the expended charge is wasted.
## Physiology
Studying the humanoid form rewards you with an understanding of anatomy, which in turn helps you predict certain behaviors, identify weaknesses, and expose flaws in your enemies. In addition, your study of the science also gives you the means to make repairs to your companions to keep them functioning at the highest levels.
When you choose this science, you gain a healer’s kit, if you don’t have one already. If you lose your kit, you can replace it for free after the adventure ends. **In addition, each time you choose this science, gain one of the following talents.**
### Cosmetology: 
You develop several techniques for modifying your appearance and the appearance of others. You can use this talent a number of times equal to 1 + your level and you regain expended uses after you complete a rest. It takes 10 minutes of work with a disguise kit or healer’s kit to use the talent on one creature within reach present for the entire time. If you target yourself, you must be able to see yourself in a reflective surface. When you finish, choose one of the following options.
- **Beautify:** The target appears beautiful and makes attack rolls in social situations with 1 boon. The effect lasts for 8 hours or until the target is immersed in liquid or takes any damage from fire.
- **Disguise:** You create a superior disguise for the target.
	The disguise abides by the normal rules for using a disguise kit, but is of a quality such that suspicious creatures automatically fail the Perception challenge roll to discern the disguise is false.
- **Malform:** The target gains the frightening trait for 8 hours or until the target becomes immersed in a liquid or takes any damage from fire.
### Creature Identification 
When you see a creature within medium range for the first time, you can make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you learn all of the target’s traits and make attack rolls against it with 1 boon until you use this talent again. If the total of your roll is 20 or higher, your attacks against the target deal an extra 1d6 damage until you use this talent again. On a failure, you learn nothing about this creature and must wait at least 1 minute before you can use this talent again.
You can use this talent a number of times equal to twice the number of times you choose Physiology. You regain all expended uses after you complete a rest.
At level 5, when you use your Creature Identification talent, you also observe the target’s behaviors. You impose 1 bane on attack rolls the target makes against you until you use Creature Identification again.
At level 8, your attacks deal 1d6 damage to target of your Creature Identification talent. In addition, whenever you roll at least one 6 on a die rolled for damage you would deal to the target of the attack, roll a d20 and add the number rolled to the damage dealt by the successful attack.
### Medical Treatment
You know how to treat injuries and ailments. You can use this talent a number of times equal to twice the number of times you choose Physiology.
You regain all expended uses after you complete a rest.
As an action, you use a healer’s kit to help one creature you can reach. It takes 1 minute of work to complete the treatment. When you finish, the target heals damage equal to its healing rate (or twice its healing rate at level 8). Alternatively, you can enable the target to make a Strength challenge roll with 1 boon and, on a success, it removes the diseased and poisoned afflictions from itself if it has them.
## Psychology
The mind holds your attention and your explorations of its corridors reveals much about the behavior of other peoples. Confrontations with the awful give you plenty of opportunities to put your talents to good use, either to gird the minds of your companions or to unravel your enemies’ mental defenses.
