Father Death’s clergy is called the Solemn Brethren, and is known for the difficulty it has recruiting initiates. In days of old, priests would claim a newborn infant once every five years, perform a funeral service for the child, and raise the baby in their cloisters to prepare him for a life of service to Thanatos. While this practice sometimes still occurs in rural communities, it has been outlawed almost everywhere in the Empire thanks to objections raised by the New God’s cultists. Instead, Father Death’s priests now run orphanages and select initiates from among the most promising children.
Training priests of Father Death proves difficult, however. Initiates spend most of their time in the gloomy bowels of their temples, learning how to prepare bodies, identify causes of death, and perform the proper rites that ensure souls reach the Underworld. The most significant rite of passage that initiates must undergo to become priests involves being buried alive for a day and a night.
Priests collect dead bodies and prepare them for burial.
They perform funeral services and counsel grieving relatives. They also protect burial sites from ghouls and robbers, and some go so far as to hunt down and destroy spirits, undead, and practitioners of Necromancy.
Devoted priests might go on to become clerics or paladins.
Priests of Father Death wear hooded black robes and use specially prepared skulls as implements.
These are first stripped of all flesh and bleached, and then they are covered with prayers to Thanatos etched into the bone and inked with black bile.
