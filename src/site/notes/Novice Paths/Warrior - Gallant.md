Speed, agility, and precision are the hallmarks of the gallant’s style. Where some warriors build their strength to heft heavy weapons in a fight, you opt to outmaneuver your enemies, striking them from many different directions and always staying just out of their reach. Your precise strikes whittle down your opponents until they finally succumb to their injuries.

| 1   | You studied with a fencing master to learn the art of swordplay.                                                                                                       |
| 2   | You hired on with a ship’s crew and went on a long voyage, during which time you learned to fight with a myriad of swift weapons.                                      |
| 3   | You fought a duel with another gallant and lost. The scar you gained on your face drove you to rethink your fighting style and learn the techniques that defeated you. |
| 4   | You found a place in a noble’s entourage and learned to use the weapons favored by your peers.                                                                         |
| 5   | Being agile, the gallant’s fighting style came to you naturally, and your skill with swift weapons represents an outgrowth of your existing talents.                   |
| 6   | Lacking the strength or durability of other warriors, you sought out a technique that would let you hold your own against tougher foes.                                |
