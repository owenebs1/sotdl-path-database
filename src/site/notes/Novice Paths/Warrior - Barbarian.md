You might have come from one of the many tribal groups found on the Empire’s edges in those places that have yet to be civilized, or you could be wild and violent, never quite fitting in with the other people living in your community.
Either way, people see you as a barbarian, one who eschews civilization’s trappings and embraces the primal nature of reality. Your skills and talents evolve not from formal training but from necessity. You fight to survive, provide for yourself, and destroy anyone or anything that threatens you.

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Fed up and disgusted, you abandoned the civilized world to live as a hermit for a time. The hardships you endured made you stronger and tougher.                                       |
| 2   | A member of a Woad tribe found you, injured and near death, and nursed you to health. You remained with these people for a time and learned their ways.                                |
| 3   | Your people have always lived in the wilderness and, after your most recent exploit, you returned to them.                                                                             |
| 4   | Monsters destroyed your community, forcing you and other survivors to live off the land in the wilds.                                                                                  |
| 5   | Uncouth, temperamental, and prone to flying off the handle without warning, your brutish nature has nothing to do with where you come from and everything to do with your personality. |
| 6   | You were taken by slavers and forced to work in the mines, fields, or elsewhere. Your time in chains stripped you of civility, reducing you to a wild and murderous creature.          |
