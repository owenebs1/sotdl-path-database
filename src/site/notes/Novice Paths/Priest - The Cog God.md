The Cog God counts clockworks and a rare few humans among its devoted priests; the religion has had little luck or interest in converting other peoples. All the priests heard their god’s call, who has compelled them to go forth, evangelize, and seek out other priests for instruction. The call comes in the form of weird patterns detected in the ticks, squeaks, and other sounds emanating from their internal mechanisms. Would-be human priests experience a different calling, which often involves recalling an existence as a clockwork, perhaps from a previous life.
Acolytes undergo a brief period of training, but with little focus on dogma or indoctrination. Instead, they spend their time learning how to build clockwork bodies and the prayers and rituals that eventually lead to fetching souls from the Underworld to inhabit and enliven the mechanical bodies. Once they have a working knowledge of magic and engineering, the acolytes become full-fledged priests, called the Assembled, and move to serve in one of the cult’s temples where they aid in constructing new clockworks and see to the congregation’s needs.
Priests of the Cog God use the Iron Cog as the symbol of their faith and clockworks affix it to their bodies, usually on their chest plates, but sometimes on their heads and faces. Humans typically wear Iron Cog medallions, although some fervent believers have tattooed it upon their foreheads. Since clockworks do not need to wear clothing, the faith has no particular vestment, though many clockwork priests wear sashes and long scarves of metallic-colored cloth stitched with geometric patterns.
