The Cult of the Dark Lady enjoys incredible power and influence within the Kingdom of Skulls, but its presence largely stops at the realm’s borders.
Beyond, those people pledged to the Dark Lady find themselves lumped in with other cultists, crackpots, and agents of evil, and suffer predictable ostracism and persecution by the Cult of the New God’s inquisitors. For this reason, the Dark Lady’s followers who go abroad keep their true allegiances secret.
Within the kingdom, the Dark lady’s cultists benefit from their high station and want for little. They watch over their mistress’s subjects, advise them on spiritual matters, and remind them that they live at her pleasure and to cross her means final death. The cultists also watch for signs of proscribed religious activity and turn followers of such faiths into martyrs.
Above all, they represent the Dark Lady’s interests, and so people in their care have come to regard them as an extension of their god-queen.
Cultists of the Dark lady don black robes and conceal their faces with devil masks marked in the center of their foreheads with the Dark Lady’s profile.
They typically carry scourges and knives for self-defense, though most rely on their spells to deal with any threats they might encounter. When they mention their mistress, they touch their foreheads with the middle two fingers on the left hand.
Merit allows a cultist to advance to a higher position. Priests of higher ranking oversee the training of initiates and manage lesser cultists under their command. The highest-ranking priests might even enjoy an audience with the Dark Lady.
