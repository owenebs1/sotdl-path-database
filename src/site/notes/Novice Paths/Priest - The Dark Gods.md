Priests of the Dark Gods come almost exclusively from the ranks of their jotun and orc followers. Physical strength, courage, and ferocity are the highest ideals among both these peoples, so most study the ways of war. Those who join the ranks of the priests often do so after receiving an omen: a three-eyed raven, a Valkyrie on the battlefield, or a one-eyed stranger joining the fire at night.
Initiates undergo rites of passage more dangerous and taxing than the rites given to their people’s warriors.
They must venture alone into the wilderness with only what gear they can carry, then spend their time in isolation, chanting and ingesting psychedelic herbs.
As they carve runes and whorls into their flesh using knives dipped in black ink, they experience visions of the future. Any acolyte who survives seven days and nights in the wild in this way returns to his or her tribe as a priest.
Vestments and Implements: Instead of robes or finery, priests of the Dark Gods display the symbols carved into their skin. They unclothe their bodies to reveal the stories etched there whenever they perform the sacred rites of the faith. All priests use the triquetra as their implement, usually wearing it as a medallion on a cord tied around the neck.
### Tenets, Strictures, and Customs:
The Dark Gods’ priests hold themselves to an even higher standard than the jotun when it comes to courage and ferocity on the battlefield. A priest must show courage in the face of all adversity, never shying away from facing the wyrd, and leading others by fearless and ferocious example.
Priests strive for greatness, even if they are not fated to find it. They lead expeditions into the Frozen Wastes to hunt the dreaded cold worms or lay waste to the hordes of the cold ones—terrifying creatures made from snow to be mockeries of mankind. They raid human lands to hunt lost relics, plunder valuable treasures, and exact vengeance for slights against their gods and people.
Battle, Destruction, and Rune are the traditions most commonly associated with the Dark Gods. However, characters worshiping specific gods can swap out two traditions for ones appropriate to the deity they serve.
For example, a character serving Tor might have Air and Storm in place of Destruction and Rune, while a character serving Eir could replace Battle and Spiritualism with Life and Nature.
