Although many lands frown on blood sport, the audiencesâ€™ appetite for carnage can never be sated. From the arenas of Qif, City of Blood, to the blood-soaked pits found in the Pirate Isles, men and women are thrown into battle against a myriad of killers, from brutal warriors who have gone mad from the violence to baited bears, lashing out from blind rage. Surviving these contests takes skill and determination, qualities you have in abundance.
You might have been forced to fight or chose this life; either way, these harrowing battles taught you everything you need to know to survive in combat.
