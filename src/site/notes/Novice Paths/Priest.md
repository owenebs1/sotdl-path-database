Priests derive magical power from pledging service to a supernatural being. Service to such entities gives priests purpose in the world and causes for which they might fight.
Faith in their patrons gives them the ability to work magic, which they perform through rite and prayer.
Discovering a tradition is a religious experience for priests. They encounter the presence of a god during their travels, feel some holy presence enter them while studying a religious text, or have a dream in which they are chosen to become divine servants. The initial experience sets these individuals on the priest’s path and gives them the power they need to further the interests of their immortal patrons.
Religion stands at the center of priests’ identities.
It shapes their behavior, gives them purpose, and reveals their traditions. Priests committed to the New God use different kinds of magic from those who follow the teachings of the Old Faith.
