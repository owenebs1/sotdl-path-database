The Cult of the New God welcomes anyone into its ranks. People of all lands and of almost any ancestry can find a place in the cultâ€”if not as a minister or priest, then as a member of the congregation. Those seeking a place in the priesthood begin their training as acolytes.
They learn to read, become versed in the finer points of theology, and eventually learn how to perform miracles through the act of prayer.
Cult leaders don special vestments when they lead ceremonies, minister to their followers, or perform rites. The colors of those vestments vary depending on position in the hierarchy, with white for priests, blue for bishops, red for cardinals, and gold for the Matriarch.

Certain orders break from this tradition, including the Swords of Astrid, who wear black, and priests of the Poor Brethren, who don robes of plain brown.
All priests of the New God use the ouroboros symbol as their implement. Priests can continue their growth in the cult by becoming clerics, paladins, or sages.
**Live by the Four Truths:** Priests are expected to uphold the Four Truths of the New God and live by them. In doing so, they must act as forces for good in the world, combating users of dark magic, slaves to the Demon Lord, and anyone else who would violate the natural order. Priests must give one-tenth of their earnings to the cult. In return, they receive haven and basic supplies from any of its temples.
