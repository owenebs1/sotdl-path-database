Shortly after you completed your first adventure, you took up with a knight to serve as his or her squire. The knight saw to your training, teaching you how to fight with lance and sword, how to wear armor, and how to care for a steed.
But most important of all were the lessons about how to conduct yourself, how to be worthy of the title of knight and the responsibilities such a station carries. You’ve completed your training and have won the right to wear heraldry, but it’s up to you to decide for whom you fight or whether you travel the lands, looking for wrongs to right and monsters to slay.

| 5   | The knight you served was poor, a drunkard, little more than a sellsword.<br>You learned what you could, but eventually abandoned him or her when you realized you could learn nothing more. |
| 6   | You accompanied your knight on many adventures and eventually earned his or her confidence, enough to release you.                                                                           |
