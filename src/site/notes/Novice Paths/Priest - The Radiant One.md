Once considered the dominant faith in the Empire, the Order of Light has all but vanished from Rûl, its adherents found largely in isolated communities as yet untouched by the New God’s missionaries.
The Order recruited acolytes heaviest from human settlements, specifically those of Kalasan descent, since the religion traces its origin back to the conquerors who crossed the Auroral Ocean.
Most land-holding families offered at least one child to serve in the faith as a position within the Order brought esteem and standing. However, as the Order’s light has dimmed in the world, the last few faithful in Nessus now accept almost anyone.
Priests of the Radiant One display their faith in the vestments and symbols they wear. They wear robes of varying colors: red by acolytes, yellow by the ordained, and white by high-ranking leaders.
Each tier is subdivided into various roles and responsibilities, denoted by the colorful trim added to the robes. Furthermore, all priests are expected to wear their god’s symbol, an amulet wrought from polished brass resembling a fiery eye encircled by wavy sun rays. Priests of the Radiant One use this as their implement for casting spells.
