Anyone who reveres nature and seeks to protect it from despoilers can find a place among the priests of the Old Faith. Most priests come to the religion from rural or wilderness professions, with farmers, herders, and hunters being the most common. The Old Faith welcomes peoples from any ancestry, though most initiates are human, halfling, or faun.
Priests and some druids take initiates in hand, teaching them the mysteries of the faith. These include rites and rituals, how to preserve peace with the fey folk, how to tend and care for animals, and methods for growing healthy and bountiful crops. Only when students demonstrate mastery of these disciplines can they undertake the rite of passage for the priesthood.
Druids oversee these rites during one of the faithâ€™s four holy festivals, questioning the initiates and testing their magical knowledge. Upon providing a satisfactory demonstration, initiates are anointed with sacred oils and welcomed into the faith.
New priests are expected to help their local communities by working the fields, helping herders with their flocks, healing the sick, and tending to the injured.
They help senior priests during festivals and lead the defense of rural communities against the myriad threats arrayed against them. Though the work is difficult, the rewards of these priestly labors show themselves in abundant crops, healthy animals, and secure communities.
Priests of the Old Faith prefer simple homespun robes. Since they spend much of their time working with the land and its animals, they often appear dirty and unkempt, with grass stains and dirt streaking their bare feet, and their robes spotted with bird droppings, mud, and spiky seedpods. Priests might use bronze sickles, staffs, or medallions made from wood, seeds, and leaves as implements.
Dedicated priests often go on to become rangers, scouts, or wardens. The most skilled priests might study the deeper mysteries of their religion and join the ranks of the druids, who protect large territories rather than small communities, and who can bring the considerable power of the Old Gods to bear in defense of their charges.
### Tenets and Strictures
Priests of the Old Faith must abide by certain strictures to remain in good standing with their gods. A priest must never kill an animal, except for food or in self-defense. Wearing or carrying objects fashioned from iron is likewise forbidden. All priests vow to protect places sacred to the Old Gods and to preserve all lands and protect them from despoilers. Finally, priests of the old faith honor the Old Gods during the equinoxes and solstices, performing the rites as they were taught.
