The magicians, with their dusty libraries crowded with tomes, and the devout priests, who surrender their lives to serving the gods, might enjoy the greatest recognition when one thinks about magic-users, but they have no monopoly on magic. The world practically hums with strange forces just waiting for someone with the talent and determination to take them up. Stories about people who stumble across magic deserve the same place as those taught the secrets in an academic setting or those given their abilities by agents of the divine.
Adept describes anyone who comes by magic through unconventional means. These spellcasters find the requisite knowledge in the most unusual places. Within themselves they discover the ability to affect change in their surroundings. Others seek out and bargain with fell powers of Hell who seem only too glad to lend a bit of
magical aid in return for a single drop of their soul. From spiritual possession to demonic influence, the ways adepts apprehend magic are as varied as they are themselves.
Even though magicians need not belong to any particular organization and priests might worship gods small and overlooked, both paths evoke images of wizard towers and grand temples, and the experts who dwell in them. Adepts have none of these things. Rather, they wield magic in a haphazard fashion, following their interests rather than a doctrine or curriculum. Thus, many find it hard to pin adepts down. They’re magic tends to reflect their own character and interests. They’re individuals with their own objectives and intentions.

# Sources of Power
A source of power describes from where you gain the ability to work your magic. Your connection to that source makes available certain talents and alters your nature.

## Celestial Madness
Out there, in the dark between the stars, in those vast, unknown gulfs of space there lurk beings of god-like potency. These entities appeared so long ago that they witnessed the formation of everything. It is to these entities you make your appeal. Though they have no use for offerings of blood or treasure, you did something to capture their attention. Noticing you, they cast their gaze upon Urth as well. Your connection to these ancient ones threatens to doom Urth. In another time, in another life, you might have cared. Now, though, you revel in the power they grant.
You embrace celestial madness after…

- …peering into space using a telescope and glimpsing an entity.
- …having a near death experience that revealed the emptiness and pointlessness of all existence.
- …traveling beyond Urth, either in the flesh or in a dream, and communing with these gibbering powers.

**Recommended Tradition:** Celestial
**Light of the Dead Star (Level 1):** When you use your Adept Recovery talent, you can choose any number of creatures within short range. Each target sheds dim light of a sickening color until the end of your next turn. The light grants 1 boon on attack rolls against the target that emits it.
**Withering Light (Level 2):** You can use this talent when you use Adept Strike. Yellow-green light erupts from a point in the target’s space to wash over each creature within 2 yards.
An affected creature makes a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d3 damage, or 1d6 damage at level 5, or 2d6 damage at level 8. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your level. You regain expended uses when you finish a rest.
**Revelations of the Utterdark (Level 8):** You can use an action to release the darkness between the stars into the world.
Black spots appear inside and expand to fill a Size 5 space originating from a point you can reach. The darkness remains for 1 minute.
When a creature other than you starts its turn in the space, the creature makes a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage, gains 1 Insanity, and becomes immobilized until the start of its next turn. Once you use this talent, you lose access to it until after you finish a rest. You regain the use early when you gain 1 Insanity.
## Demonic Influence
A voice whispers in your mind. It tells you horrible things, just awful things, describing experiences and sensations available only to people who have cast aside their humanity. The knowledge gnaws at your mental defenses making you more and more susceptible to delusions and paranoia. Above all else, you feel a disgust for the world that grows. You sense the wrongness in its existence, as if the world were some kind of abomination. You sometimes catch yourself breaking small objects and hurting things smaller than yourself. When angered, you lash out and your reckless magic use sometimes causes unnecessary destruction and harm. You try to fight the urges. You clamp down on them for now. How long can you stay in control?
You suffer from demonic influence after…

- …a priest freed you from demonic possession.
- …you encountered a demon in the flesh.
- …being tortured by cultists devoted to the Hunger in the Void.

**Recommended Tradition:** Demonology
**Hunger of the Void (Level 1):** When you use your Adept Recovery talent, each creature in reach makes a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 damage.

In addition, at the end of each round, any creatures in the shadows other than you take 1d3 damage. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your level. You regain expended uses when you finish a rest.
**Void Step (Level 8):** At the start of your turn in combat, you can use this talent to roll a d6. If you roll a 5 or 6, you can choose an empty space you can see within medium range and teleport to that space.
## Devilish Pact
You had your reasons. At the time, you thought them good reasons. And if you have any regrets about pawning your soul to the devils, you don’t bother focus on them. Pining for “could-have-beens” gets you nowhere. There’s no chance for redemption, for you gave away the only thing that matters. You sold your soul and signed your name in blood. Even if you could get the contract, you have no idea if you could destroy it. No. The horse left the barn, the ship sailed, and so on. It’s too late for you. Might as well enjoy what you have while you have it!
You bargained away your soul…

- …to create a masterpiece.
- …to win affection from someone who didn’t even know you were alive.
- …to gain power, reputation, status in a world you believed was out to get you.

**Recommended Tradition:** Curse
**Ruinous Temptation (Level 1):** When you use the Adept Recovery talent, you can choose to forgo healing the damage to instead target one creature you can see within medium range.

You retain Favor until you spend it or you finish a rest. When you would make an attack roll or challenge roll, but before you roll the dice, you can expend 1 Favor to roll an additional d20 and use either result. If both dice come up as the same number, you gain 1 Corruption.
## Divine Decree
Devout or otherwise, you never imagined you would commit your life to serving a god. You, like other folks, thought you had some different fate. All your plans fell away though, when a god raised you above the rest. You became an agent of this god, a vessel whose existence, it seems, serves only the god’s interests.
The moment of your selection occurred…

- …when the god appeared before you.
- …after you suffered a brief bout of madness.
- …when you spoke a blasphemy against that god or defiled some site holy to the power.

If a creature is immune to gaining Insanity, it instead takes 3d6 damage on a failed roll.
Then, until this effect ends, you become immune to damage from disease and poison, as well as to the charmed, compelled, dazed, defenseless, diseased, frightened, immobilized, poisoned, slowed, and stunned afflictions. Once you use this talent, you lose access to it until after you finish a rest. You regain the use of this talent early after you gain 1 Insanity.
## Elemental Mark
You feel the earth stir under your feet. You hear the wind whisper your name. You see figures in the flames and your ears prick up to the laughter in the burbling stream. You have a connection to the elemental powers, those genies who shaped creation from raw chaos.
These entities left their mark upon you…

- …as you belong to an elemental ancestry.
- …after you stumbled into a cave a genie haunts.
- …after you were buried alive, fell from a great height, nearly drowned, or became trapped in a burning building.

## Faerie Pledge
When you knelt before the great fey, on your knees, you offered up your miserable life to further whatever cause the faerie wished. The faerie accepted your pledge of service and bestowed on you many blessings. You now champion the immortal and commit your remaining days to act on your patron’s behalf.
You made this pledge…

- …in gratitude after the faerie saved your life.
- …to gain freedom after spending years in the faerie’s thrall.
- …to earn your patron’s love and affection.

with a dragon, of all things, or you might just be fated to accomplish great deeds. You could even be the seventh child of a seventh child.

You discovered your abilities after…

## Spiritual Possession
A foreign entity resides in your body. When this first happened, you lost days at a time. People would mention happenings involving you but of them you had no memory.
Somehow, you made peace with the spirit possessing you and formed an alliance. Now, the spirit lets you work wonders in return for helping it accomplish its goals.
You became possessed…

- …after visiting a haunted location.
- …when a bright light shone from above and blasted your memory into pieces.

The first time yo take damage before this effect ends, you instead take half the damage and the effect ends early.
**Spirit Allies (Level 2):** When you use Adept Strike or use an action to Find, Help, Stabilize, or attack with an attribute (Shadow, pages 51-52), you can do so from your space or any space you choose within short range.

## Unspeakable Knowledge
No one knows better than you that some truths should to stay secret. The reality others perceive is nothing more than an illusion, but a necessary illusion all the same. If others see what you see, know what you know, they will go insane.
Even your disciplined mind buckles under the weight of your unspeakable knowledge. Still, this informatio enables you to work wonders by defying reality’s laws.
You discovered these unwholesome truths when you…

- …read a forbidden tome.
- …suffered from a series of worsening nightmares.
- …underwent indoctrination after joining a weird cult.

**Recommended Tradition:** Madness (Occult Philosophy)
**Unhinged Recovery (Level 1):** If you lack the frightened affliction when you use your Adept Recovery talent, you can choose to gain 1 Insanity. If so, you do not become frightened. Instead, you make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon for a number of rounds equal to your Insanity total.
