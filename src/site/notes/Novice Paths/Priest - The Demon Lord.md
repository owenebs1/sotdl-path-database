Since player characters can come from any background, have any occupation, and might hold to a variety of different beliefs, some might fall in with one of the demonic cults described here or one of your creation. Characters in service to the Demon Lord might not be appropriate for all groups, so it’s up to you to decide if these options are available to players.
Cultists hide in the Empire and the surrounding lands to avoid witch hunters and inquisitors. Most of them keep out of the public eye, quietly serving their dark master and deriving magical ability from the power of their belief. Most of the Demon Lord’s priests stand at the center of their cults, serving as the leaders who keep the cultists in line and focused on their mission.
A few priests of the Demon Lord wander, much in the manner of the itinerant priests of the gods.
These individuals are often cast into this lot after their cult cell was uncovered and destroyed or because they became enthralled with the Demon Lord from encountering a demon, from finding a Void-stained relic, or because they’re crazy.
If a player creates a character for a group of level 1 or higher, the Indoctrination table can explain how that character became a priest of the Demon Lord.
