When your nation called for soldiers, you answered. You might have helped to fight pirates or jotun raiding the coastlines, defended against the undead spilling out from the Desolation or the Kingdom of Skulls, or stood shoulder to shoulder with others against the orc invasion. Joining an army taught you how to fight and the discipline you need to hold the line even when the situation turns grim. You watched out for your fellows, who in turn had your back and guarded your flanks. You might have found victory and glory, or faced bitter defeat, but whatever happened, you emerged from the experience changed and prepared to take the fight to your enemies.
