You learned early on that a threat means nothing unless you can make good on it. Fear and pain have become your weapons. You exude menace, the threat written in your eyes and in the way you carry yourself. Your mere appearance lets others know it’s dangerous to cross your path, and when they do, you don’t waste time mincing words. You strike hard and fast, so that when you land a blow, it hurts.
