The decadent priesthood of the Queen of Spiders enjoys incredible power over the arachne people. They speak for the dread goddess and so their pronouncements are law.
The Demon Queen favors them with foul magic enabling them to snuff out life, assume monstrous forms, and call forth demons from the Void. They are a vile people, their souls darkened by their sickening desires and their rapacious acts of cruelty.
