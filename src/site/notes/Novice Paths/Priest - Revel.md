Revel’s cultists come from every corner of the world and all walks of life. His followers might be farmers, prostitutes, drunkards, addicts, criminals—or anyone nurturing the desire to indulge in hedonistic pursuits.
Humans, halflings, fauns, orcs, and even goblins might find a place in the Laughing God’s cult. Pledging service to Revel comes at a price, though, for the god is madness incarnate. Those who serve him become erratic and undisciplined, if not downright crazy.
The Laughing God places few demands on his servants. Above all, he urges them to savor life in all its aspects, and to indulge to the point of excess. Priests are also encouraged to follow their hearts, even if it means breaking local laws or customs. Other common strictures include never refusing a drink, honoring the faeries, and being generous in all things.
During festivals, Revel’s priests wear comical masks that appear faintly sinister. If they bother to wear clothing, it’s loose and unrestrictive, so as to be easily removed for lovemaking. All priests of Revel use thyrsus-shaped wands as their implements. The most devoted priests might go on to become oracles, berserkers, or mountebanks.
