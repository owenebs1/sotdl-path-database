Monasteries dot the continent, built by religious or philosophical institutions to protect sacred writings and relics, and offering a place of retreat for those seeking wisdom. Life in these places tends to be simple, with opportunities for introspection and reflection on the soul. Labor ensures the monks living there keep themselves fit and able, but some places teach combat training, revealing ways to turn fists and feet into weapons. Many who complete this training go on to become mystics in hopes of harnessing their inner power.

| 1   | You sheltered at a monastery to recover from the horrors and hardships you<br>have endured. There, between bouts of meditation, you trained your body to<br>become a living weapon.           |
| 2   | You sought out a famous martial artist and earned a place as his or her student.                                                                                                              |
| 3   | You joined a society of friars, where you brewed beer, tended the gardens,<br>and learned how to brawl.                                                                                       |

| 5   | You abandoned the world to live as a hermit for a time. In your isolation, you<br>trained your body to resist the hardships and learned how to defend yourself<br>as a result.                |
| 6   | You were raised in a monastery and returned to complete your training.<br>Having done so, you are now ready to return to the world and, if possible,<br>leave it better than you found it.    |
