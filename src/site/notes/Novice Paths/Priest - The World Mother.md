Priests of the World Mother are nearly all women, with men drawn to her husband, the Horned King.
Individuals who choose this life feel a special connection to the goddess, having glimpsed her in their dreams, or perhaps stumbling upon her while she bathes in the still waters of a forest pool. Her priests are healers, protectors, and wisdoms, and their presence in a community is considered a great boon.
Priests of the World Mother must generally abide by the same strictures as do priests of the Old Faith.
However, they never eat the flesh of animals, adhering to a strict vegetarian diet. If a priest breaks this tenet, her Power score drops to 0 until she completes a rest.
The World Mother also urges her priests to marry and have many children.
Priests of the World Mother favor soft robes in natural colors, with green and brown being the most common.
In times of difficulty, they might don leathers and strap shields to their arms. All priests use small idols of the goddess as their implements, usually carving them from stone smoothed by a riverâ€™s waters, then stringing them on cords about their necks. Dedicated priests go on to become druids, rangers, or wardens.
