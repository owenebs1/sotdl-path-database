The Devil entices mortals and immortals alike to serve his interests with offers of wealth, power, and the fulfillment of any desire, no matter how sordid or vile. Since pledging service to Diabolus guarantees damnation, people who serve do so with full knowledge of what awaits them in the afterlife and, through a combination of self-deception and denial, believe they can forestall the horror to come through constant and dedicated service to their dark master. The Devil’s minions work to further their master’s interests by corrupting people in positions of power, infiltrating and subverting powerful organizations, and by recruiting others to join their diabolical cause.
Few people outwardly display their devotion to the Devil, knowing that such an affiliation invites attention from the Inquisition and other foes of Hell. Instead, they mask their true nature with upstanding, virtuous, and noble facades, appearing to all others as exemplary members of their communities.
However, on certain nights of the year, the Devil-worshipers gather in secret, coming together to conduct those rites and rituals required by their faith to honor Diabolus and gain his dire blessings. Exceptions, of course, exist. Darklings, for example, make no secret of their fidelity to the Devil, wearing his symbols on their persons and invoking his dark name in their prayers.
In Set, the City of Gods, there stands a temple dedicated to the Lord of Lies, where his priests carry out their vile rituals in full view.
The sordid particulars of a Devil-worshiping cult’s initiation varies from sect to sect, though most involve the eating of raw flesh, copious drug use, orgies, torture, sacrifice, and the casting of dark spells. Initiates wear masks, usually of angelic appearance, and are forced to perform a series of debased and humiliating acts until they have satisfied the other cultists as to their loyalty and commitment to Diabolus. Few emerge from initiation with their sanity intact.
Since enemies lay on all sides, priests of the Devil rely in secret signs to communicate their faith. Several signs are known. The most common is to make the devil’s horns by extending the forefinger and pinky away from the hand, while curling down the middle fingers behind the outstretched thumb.
Others include a trident worn as a trinket or a tattoo, the speaking of a phrase such as “Embrace the Father’s Fires,” or by shaking with one’s left hand while applying light pressure on the wrist.
People fear the Devil for good reason. No ally to mortals, the Devil seeks total dominion of the Urth and to make all its people his slaves. He reaches up from his fiery realm to pull the strings of countless agents he has installed in various positions of incredible power and influence. His ambition leaves no room for invasion from an outside threat, however, and Diabolus opposes the Demon Lord and the horrors of the Void as vigorously as every other deity and faith in the world, and he expects the same of anyone who serves him.
