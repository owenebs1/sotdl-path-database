Old Man Winter has a small number of followers within the Empire, but most dwell beyond its borders to the south, where they live as freaks, renegades, and killers.
Devotees of Anemoi gather in small bands, roaming across the lands they inhabit. They scourge themselves to deaden their flesh against the cold, and most show the signs of having suffered frostbite—missing fingers, ears, and lips. Before gaining full membership in the cult, initiates must survive stripping down and spending three nights outdoors in the dead of winter.
Priests of Old Man Winter live simply, forgoing the comforts of civilization and ridding themselves of anything more than the barest means of subsistence.
Eschewing armor, they go into battle wearing nothing more than breechclouts. Moreover, priests can warm themselves at others’ fires, but they are forbidden from starting them.
Priests regularly test their combat prowess against others in their order, fighting until one combatant is unconscious. They might also seek tougher foes, hunting weird monsters and leading raids against any folk deemed to be the enemies of their faith.
Before heading into battle, Anemoi’s priests daub their bodies with thick blue paint crafted from a rare fungus that grows under the snow. They believe the special substance gives them magical protection. Whether it does or not, the paints are also hallucinogenic, so that priests see and hear things they interpret as signs and omens. Anemoi’s priests use spears as implements, reflecting the weapon their god wields. The most devoted followers of Old Man Winter might go on to become berserkers or elementalists.
