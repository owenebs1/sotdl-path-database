The Horned King’s cult has no place in the civilized world. A wild religion, it is a cult steeped in blood rituals and mysticism, and a throwback to a more savage time.
Human or faun barbarians, savage warriors, and hunters are the people most likely to embrace the cult. Although many strive to join the Horned Ones, as they are known, only those who have glimpsed the fantastical beast known as the Green Stag are invited to become initiates.
The stag reveals itself to any suitable candidate, luring that supplicant deeper and deeper into the wilderness.
When the supplicant becomes hopelessly lost, a priest appears, inviting him or her to join the faith.
The priests of the Horned King abide by the strictures of the Old Faith, but when they kill an animal, they must waste nothing. Using every part of the animal shows respect for its sacrifice, and it speeds the animal’s spirit to the Underworld to be born again. Normally, Horned Ones patrol the lands they pledge to protect, much in the manner of other Old Faith priests. Their focus, however, remains on protecting the beasts that share their lands.
Priests of the Horned King wear armor made from the bones and hides of animals they have slain. They wear animal masks to call forth the beast spirit within them, and paint their skin with mud.
As hunters, the Horned Ones use their weapons as implements, channeling the power of their god through their spears and bows.
Devoted priests might go on to become scouts, rangers, or wardens, finding new ways to serve their god.
