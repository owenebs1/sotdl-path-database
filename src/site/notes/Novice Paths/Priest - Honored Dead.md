The priests of the Honored Dead wield almost as much power in their communities as the thanes and guild masters of the dwarfs. As such, membership in the priesthood is reserved for exceptional individuals who have proven their worthiness. Acolytes spend decades studying the Annals of the Dead, from which they learn the histories of their clans, as well as the rites and rituals they are required to perform. Only a few ever successfully meet the high demands of this process, but
thereâ€™s no shame in not being chosen. Dwarfs who have made unsuccessful attempts at entering the priesthood can always find other ways to serve their communities.
Priests are the heart and soul of dwarfen culture, the moral authority in dwarfen communities, and the example by which all other dwarfs conduct themselves.
They lead exemplary lives, acting with honor and putting the needs of their clans and community above their own. In battle, priests stand in the front ranks, their songs and chants raising spirits and bolstering courage. They gather the fallen, anoint their bodies with tears, and inter them in the honored towers. They preserve the Annals of the Dead, recording the wrongs done to their people and the great deeds done by dwarf heroes.
Only on holy days or when preparing the dead do the priests of the Honored Dead don the vestments of their faith. These are robes made from steel coins and steel masks wrought to resemble the faces of their most famous kin. Lesser priests carry censers from which the sweet smell of burning incense wafts, while high priests carry the great tomes that hold the lore of their clans.
Dwarfs favor hammers and axes in combat, and dwarfen priests are no exception. Nearly all use weapons as implements, decorating them with sacred runes and sigils. Those dwarf priests who seek to further their studies and service to the Honored Dead might become clerics, oracles, or shamans.
