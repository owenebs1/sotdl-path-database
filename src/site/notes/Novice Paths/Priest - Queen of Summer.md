The priests of the Queen of Summer welcome anyone into their congregations, but they are selective about who gets to join them. They look for passion, intelligence, and creativity first and foremost, knowing that they can foster stronger devotion as a candidate is initiated into their ranks.
The Queen of Summer expects her servants to beautify the world. Priests counsel young couples before marriage and then lead the rites for those who are deemed suitable for each other. They seek out and encourage artists, celebrating their works. They settle disputes, promote peace, and foster joy in all folk they meet. Followers of the goddess are expected to be honest, to never discourage others in their endeavors and to always work toward good ends. All priests of the goddess prize beautiful things, but they also look beyond the forms of beauty to see what lies within, always seeking to understand the virtues of the people they meet.
Priest of the queen of Summer wear thin red robes that they accent with religious symbols. A medallion of polished brass or bronze on a chain of the same material is the only implement used by her priests. The medallion's face shows either the sun of the goddess's face. Dedicated servants of the Queen of Summer might go on to become druids, sorcerers, or mountebanks.
