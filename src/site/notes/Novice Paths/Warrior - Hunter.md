Whether you grew up on the frontiers, where hunting remains a necessary part of survival, or honed your abilities tracking down criminals to face justice, your training helps you find your prey and bring it down with ease. When on the hunt, you know how to move without betraying your position and where best to hide to escape notice. You learn patience and can keep still for long hours before striking.
Unlike other warriors, your weapon training focuses on those used in your trade: the spear for fighting bears and boars, bows for bringing down game from a distance, and knives and daggers to protect you when all else fails.

| 1   | You retreated to the wilderness to grapple with the experiences you have had so far. Living off the land helped you develop your hunting skills.                                         |
| 2   | After an enemy slipped out of your grasp, you committed several weeks to tracking that person down and bringing him or her to justice.                                                   |
| 3   | You tracked down and slew a monster that was harassing your community.                                                                                                                   |
| 4   | When a company of soldiers passed through your town, you joined up to scout for them. Your experience taught you much about keeping your eyes open and staying out of view.              |
| 5   | Foul creatures swept through your community. You helped to fight them off but, seeing the situation as hopeless, you led the survivors through the wilds to safety.                      |
| 6   | When a caravan bound for your town went missing, you and a few others set out to find the travelers. You came back empty-handed, but you learned much about surviving in the wilderness. |
