Dwarfs live in the shadow cast by their ancestors, silent spectators who watch over their descendants until the time comes for them to return to the world once more in the bodies of newborn dwarfs. The faith devoted to the Honored Dead preserves their histories, ensures dwarfs live and act as their ancestors expect, and inspires them through the old tales to reach for heroic heights in all that they do. Priests hold an important place within dwarf culture, and when they speak, their authority equals that of the kings and queens.
Chroniclers emerge from the ranks of the Honored Dead’s priesthood as the keepers of the old lore and commit to memory all the old tales and stories of their kind. They tattoo their flesh with their family’s history, using every available place on their bodies to preserve the lore. This act of devotion earns them esteem from their ancestors and, when chroniclers call upon them for aid, the runic script covering their bodies flares to life, protecting, inspiring, and sustaining them.
While the chronicler expert path is intended for dwarfs who adhere to the tenets of the Honored Dead, you can adapt the path to any people who might venerate their ancestors.

| 1   | A priest of the Honored Dead already, you became enamored with your people’s history and vowed to preserve and add to it with those events you witness.        |
| 2   | After monsters overran your ancestral home and destroyed much of the sacred writings, you used your body to recount what you remembered of your people’s past. |
| 3   | The runes etched into your flesh describe all the wrongs done to you and your kind. You display the script so your enemies will know why you kill them.        |
