Conjuration magic creates physical creatures and objects by weaving together threads of magical energy. Normally, the magic responsible for these creations unravels in time, the spell weakening until the conjured items dissipate in a cloud of sparkling energy. Efforts to make these creations persist longer have had mixed results, though Conjuration spells of higher ranks are evidence of successful attempts.
Among those who have made a study of the art, the thrallbinders have had the greatest success. Using advanced techniques uncovered through research and experimentation, they can bring forth powerful thralls to do their bidding.
The thralls that thrallbinders create vary as wildly as do their creators and can take almost any form their creators desire. Some thralls look almost human, while others resemble beasts, and others still appear to be masses of writhing tentacles, creations of gear and cog, or just about anything else.
Regardless of their forms, thralls have the same basic characteristics as given below.

| 1   | You stumbled onto the secrets of thrallbinding, having created a small monster with a spell and finding that your creation stayed around far longer than its normal duration would allow.               |
| 2   | You traveled to a great institution of magical learning and there learned how to make longer-lasting creations.                                                                                         |
| 3   | You have been haunted for much of your life. Rather than your thrall reflecting some new breakthrough in magic, you have learned to trap and control the haunting presence in a creation of your magic. |
| 4   | You pursued your art in a vain attempt to restore someone you lost to life.                                                                                                                             |
| 5   | After several brushes with death, you shifted your work toward making creatures to protect you from harm.                                                                                               |
| 6   | The process of thrallbinding is yet one more step on the road to your mastery of Conjuration magic.                                                                                                     |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Conjuration tradition or you learn one Conjuration spell.
**Conjured Thrall** You can use an action to conjure a [[Bestiary/Conjured Thrall\|thrall]].
Choose a cube of space originating from a point within short range, and the thrall appears in that space. The thrall counts as a creature you have created by a Conjuration spell you have cast. It remains until you complete a rest or until the thrall is destroyed, at which point it disappears.
The thrall is friendly to you and members of your group.
It takes one turn per round, acting when you do, and performs as you direct it (not an action) provided it remains within medium range. You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Power, but you cannot have more than one thrall at a time. You regain expended uses of this talent when you complete a rest.
**Directed Strike** When a thrall you have created using a talent gained from this path would attack, you can use a triggered action and expend the casting of a Conjuration spell to grant 1 or more boons on the attack roll. The number of boons granted equals the rank of the spell whose casting you expended (minimum 1 boon).
**Infusion of Magic** If a thrall you have created using a talent gained from this path is within short range of you, you can use an action and expend the casting of a rank 1 or higher Conjuration spell to heal the thrall. The thrall heals 1d6 damage per rank of the spell whose casting you expended.
# Level 6
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Improved Conjured Thrall** When you use your Conjured Thrall talent, you can create an [[Bestiary/Improved Conjured Thrall\|Improved Conjured Thrall]] instead of a conjured thrall. Whenever you use Infusion of Magic to heal this thrall, you instead heal damage equal to 2d6 per rank of the spell whose casting you expended.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Greater Conjured Thrall** When you use your Conjured Thrall talent, you can create a [[Bestiary/Greater Conjured Thrall\|Greater Conjured Thrall]] instead of a conjured thrall. Whenever you use Infusion of Magic to heal this thrall, you instead heal damage equal to 3d6 per rank of the spell whose casting you expended.
