In many religions across Rûl, choirs lift up their voices to honor their gods, their music filling the air and reaching the realms of the divine. In temples, these songs contribute to the otherworldly nature of the ceremonies the priests perform, helping to transport the congregants from the misery of their world to a place that stimulates the senses. Many such singers are fellow congregants, people who use their talents for worship. But for those of constant faith who have the blessing of their gods, the music can be more than simple hymns—it can give voice to the gods themselves.
Psalmists can belong to any religion. Nearly all begin their careers in the clergy, indoctrinated in the secrets of their faith. These individuals stand apart from other priests by the strength of their voices and channel the power of their gods through song. Although they are most common among the Cult of the New God, one can find psalmists among the followers of the Old Faith, the Dark Gods, and other deities.
