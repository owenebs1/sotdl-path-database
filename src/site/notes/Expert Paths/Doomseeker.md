A terrible compulsion drives doomseekers to complete a specific quest. They must complete the mission on pain of death. Whether they admit it or not, they earned their fates by crossing someone or something more powerful than themselves. One might have stolen a bauble from the Great Dragon, while another might have given grave offense to the Faerie Queen by killing one of her prized subjects.
Rather than kill the offending actor, the power bestowed a terrible curse upon them, a curse that compels them to perform a particular service.
The quest required by the geas equals the offense given. A doomseeker who dared steal a bauble from the Great Dragon might have to retrieve a fabled relic said to be housed in the Cloud Castle of Varnesh that drifts across the skies above the Endless Steppe.
Another who slew the prized consort of a faerie lord or lady might be sent to fetch a measure of Heart Water from the legendary Lake of Sorrows said to rest at the center of destroyed Niflheim.
**Designing Quests:** When you choose this path, work with the Game Master to come up with the offense that resulted in your geas and the nature of the quest you must undertake to lift it. Completing the quest is not something you are expected to achieve during the campaign. Instead, the quest describes what you do after the campaign ends and its fulfillment becomes the stuff of legend. Even though the quest lies outside your group’s story, fulfilling it should become your character’s driving motivation and the GM might tailor adventures or scenes to your story to help you make progress toward completing your mission or to show ways in which your efforts are frustrated.
