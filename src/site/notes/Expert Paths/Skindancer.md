Skindancers are spellcasters who place special focus on Alteration and Transformation magic. Their studies provide them with ways to cast their spells more quickly and with more versatile effects. Skindancers can become almost anyone they choose by rearranging their features to suit their needs. In time, they can even alter their bodies to repair injuries and rid themselves of toxins.
Although anyone with an interest in learning spells from the traditions associated with this path might profit from taking up this path, skindancers often come from the ranks of killers, spies, and saboteurs, since they have the means to go places where others cannot by dint of the flexibility of their forms. Such individuals are widely feared, since the usual methods for uncovering changelings don’t work on them.
