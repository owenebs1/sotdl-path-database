Confronting the darkness in the world might be an act worthy of heroes, but even the valiant champions find their efforts come at a cost. Contending with demons, undead, and those spirits freed from the Underworld and Hell can strain the mind to the point of breaking as the true nature of reality and the myriad threats it contains become apparent. Some buckle under the pressure, minds splintering, but some manage to persevere, somehow finding a way to hold themselves together long enough to triumph over their enemies.
The fractured represent those people who have confronted mind-blasting horror and have managed, through sheer force of will, to overcome it, though even they bear signs of the strain they have suffered. Rather than be crippled by their experience, they learn survival techniques to help them maintain their cool when they would face the same again. Even as their minds reel from terror, they can keep their wits long enough to do what needs doing.
