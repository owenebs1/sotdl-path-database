People swell the great cities and fill the towns to bursting, but there are always those who prefer the pristine wilderness to the crowded conditions and stink of civilized lands. These wilderness-dwelling folks might have had their choice thrust on them, having been exiled or forced to flee the ruins of their homeland, but most belong to tribal societies or live in primitive conditions. Some of these people embrace the wild places and become adept at surviving in some of the harshest environments. These people are the outlanders.
Outlanders become predators and cunning survivors. They keep their own company and protect their hunting lands with the same aggression found in giant apes, big cats, and similar creatures. They favor an aggressive fighting style, striking quickly to overwhelm their prey, but have the means to slip away in case the fight turns against them.
For all that they prefer the seclusion offered by the wild, circumstances often force outlanders to work with others. Rampaging bands of beastmen, orc brigands, foul monsters, and other dangers can see outlanders joining forces with adventuring groups to drive the darkness back.
