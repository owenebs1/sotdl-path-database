You have become as a god. Some might call it hubris, but you see it as necessary to fully understand the universe. In scouring the secrets of alchemy, biology, chemistry, and more, you have made crucial connections between them that have let you bring forth new life. A shocking creation, the supposed wrongness of your work shows in its unnatural appearance, but this is just a step on the road to even greater discoveries.

| 1   | You were kicked out of Lij’s Academy for your unorthodox experiments. You will show them you were right. You will show them all!                                      |
| 2   | A friend or loved one died. You have spent every second since trying to find a way to bring that person back.                                                         |

# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase both by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +1
**Languages and Professions** You gain two academic areas of scholarship of your choice.
**Secret Laboratory** You have a secret laboratory filled with 100 gc worth of rare equipment. Work with the GM to place the laboratory in an area where it remains hidden. If you lose your laboratory, you can construct another one by acquiring the equipment you lost by whatever means you have available—purchase, theft, murder, and so on.
**Arise, My Creation!** You can spend 1 hour working in your laboratory to permanently transform one size 1/2 or 1 dead creature, or a defenseless living creature you have restrained, into your monstrous creation. You decide on the monstrous creation’s appearance: it might be assembled from body parts crudely stitched together, fitted with mechanical accessories, or something else.
If you use this talent on a living creature, you gain 1 Corruption. The monstrous creation is compelled by you until you use an action to release it or you use this talent again. If you are ever more than 1 mile from the creation, it removes the compelled affliction from itself.
**Onward, My Creation!** When the monstrous creation makes an attack roll or challenge roll and can hear you, you can use a triggered action to grant 2 boons on the triggering roll.

**Improved Creations** Whenever you use Arise, My Creation, you can increase the monstrous creation’s Size by 1 or all four of its attributes by 1 each. In addition, the creation gains two traits of your choice.
**Stitch It Up** You can repair constructs and clockworks. If you spend at least 1 hour working with a tool kit, make an Intellect challenge roll with 1 boon for each hour you spend working after the first. On a success, the target heals damage equal to its healing rate. If you rolled a 20 or higher, the target heals extra damage equal to its healing rate.
# Level 9
