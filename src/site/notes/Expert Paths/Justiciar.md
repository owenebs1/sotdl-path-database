Most associate the Seer with oracles, diviners, and fortunetellers, individuals who read the skein of reality to follow the threads of fate and untangle the possible futures. Most priests of the Seer have withdrawn from the world, dwelling in isolation to commune undisturbed with their deity and to consider the information they gain. Yet the Seer has ever been more than the father of fates, the author of dooms. He also champions justice in the world, his named invoked by judges and nobles alike to gain his wisdom when passing judgment on the guilty.
Before the rise of the New God’s cult, servants of the Seer called justiciars traveled the lands of the Empire to weigh in on criminal cases and lend their expertise to solving crimes and ascertaining the guilt of the accused. As Astrid’s following has grown, though, so too has intolerance for the old ways; the justiciars found themselves unwelcome and, in time, largely vanished. A few remain, though, and they have the vision and cunning to get to the truth of almost any matter.

| 1   | You apprenticed to a traveling justiciar, learning the tenets of the faith and the methods used to discern guilt.                                                                                                                                           |

**Magic** Choose one of the following options:
- Discover the Curse, Divination, or Telepathy tradition
- Learn one Curse, Divination, or Telepathy spell

**Word of the Seer** You do not gain Corruption from discovering the Curse tradition, nor are you at risk of gaining Corruption from learning Curse spells.
**Weigh Guilt** You can use an action to determine the guilt or innocence of one target creature you can see within short range. Make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you learn all of the following information about the target:
- Its name and general identity
- Its Corruption score, if any
- Whether it has stolen, murdered, assaulted, or committed an act of similar violence at any time within the last 24 hours.
If the target has a Corruption score or committed an act of violence, for 1 minute, you make attack rolls against the target with 1 boon and the target makes challenge rolls to resist your attacks with 1 bane.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Pass Judgment** When a creature you can see deals damage, you can use a triggered action to pass judgment on the triggering creature. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes cursed for 1 minute, until you use an action to lift the curse, or you use this talent again. For the purpose of removing curses, this effect counts as a spell of a rank equal to your Power score.
While cursed in this way, the target is impaired and slowed. Once you use this talent, you must make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, you lose the talent until you complete a rest.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Burden of Guilt** You can use an action to expend the casting of a rank 1 or higher spell you have learned to punish the guilty. Each creature cursed by you takes 1d6 damage per rank of the spell you expended. A creature that would take this damage can make a Will challenge roll, taking half the damage on a success.
