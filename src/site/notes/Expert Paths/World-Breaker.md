Wherever world-breakers go, ruin follows. For most spellcasters, becoming a world-breaker is evidence of some sickness of the mind, some fracture in one’s sanity, for no one should willingly become such a force for devastation. Mad they all are, for they dabble in ruinous energies that afflict the minds of these spellcasters even as they can reduce everything around them to rubble. For this reason, mages from the Tower Arcane watch for signs of the presence of a world-breaker, and their agents follow up rumors of such activities so that when the mages of the Tower find their source, they can move swiftly to put the renegade down.
Most people who become world-breakers show signs of mental deficiency, usually a result of some trauma related to their craft, but a rare few find themselves on this path after discovering some unexpected talent for magery. Generally, world-breakers have plenty of quirks—twitching, giggling, and talking to people who aren’t there. Whether these delusions are truly madness or result from some special awareness, none can truly say.

# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +3, Power +1, Insanity +1
**Magic** You discover the Chaos or Destruction tradition or you learn one Chaos or Destruction spell.
**Chaotic Destruction** Whenever you cast a Chaos spell, roll a d6. On a 6, you gain 1 Insanity. You do not become frightened from gaining Insanity in this way; instead, chaotic energy spills out from your body for a number of rounds equal to your Insanity score. Until this effect ends, any creature that starts its turn within 1 yard of you or moves to such a location must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take 1d6 damage plus 1d6 damage per point of your Power score. In addition, Destruction spells you cast deal 1d6 extra damage.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Great Chaos** When your Chaotic Destruction talent is triggered, the area it affects expands into an area with a radius of 1d6 + 1 yards centered on a point in your space.
In addition, in the round in which it takes effect, each creature in the area is subject to the effect of [wild magic](https://sotdl-spell-database.vercel.app/spells/chaos/wild-magic/) as if you had cast that spell. Finally, the extra damage that Chaotic Destruction applies to Destruction spells you cast increases to 2d6.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +3, Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Chaos from Destruction** You can use an action and expend the casting of a Destruction spell to cast any Chaos spell, even one you have not yet learned, of the same or a lower rank.
**Controlled Chaos** Whenever you cast a Chaos spell, you can choose to add the spell’s rank to your roll of a d6 to determine if your Chaotic Destruction talent is triggered.
