In the most remote reaches of time and space, impossible beings exist, alien gods of such size and power that to apprehend them fully is to go mad forever. Some have sought to consult with these beings, to gain insights from them and thus transcend the limits of their own bodies and minds, but most who do find themselves drawn into psychosis. Farseers, however, have trained their minds to withstand the rigors of such communion, to gird their personalities against mental assault so that they can understand their dread patrons more fully.
Most farseers come from the ranks of those seekers of forbidden knowledgeâ€”individuals who, for one reason or another, believe no secret should be secure, no knowledge should be denied to them. For every farseer who masters the essential talents of the art, a dozen more succumb to madness, their minds buckling under the strain of their investigations. Yet those who survive the training with their faculties more or less intact find their vistas broadened, the possibilities for what they can achieve becoming almost endless.

| 1   | You sailed across the Nyxian Ocean and beheld evidence of an ancient, unknowable god. The experience shattered your mind, but you were able to salvage much of your psyche to benefit from what you have learned. |
| 2   | A student of the occult, you became aware of alien powers beyond Urth and devoted yourself to their study.                                                                                                        |
| 3   | You fell in with the apostles of the Cabal of the Black Sun and learned from them certain truths you can never unlearn.                                                                                           |
| 4   | You found a weird statue, medallion, or some other trinket. Proximity to the device stirs your dreams, transporting you to a nightmarish realm where great powers thrash in their sleep.                          |
| 5   | You took up with a minor cult that sought wisdom from the stars. You were the only survivor of their foolish efforts.                                                                                             |
| 6   | Memories of a past life haunt you. In that existence, you knew things you should never have learned.                                                                                                              |
