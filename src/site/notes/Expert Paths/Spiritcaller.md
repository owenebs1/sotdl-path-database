Among the Woad and other peoples living in the wild, there are certain individuals who can peer beyond reality’s veil and see into the spirit world, which is believed to encompass all of creation. These people, called spiritcallers, sometimes bond with the spirits of nature they find in this realm and can call upon them for aid. These magic-users occupy important places in their tribes and serve their people as protectors.
Spiritcallers depend on the connections they establish with the spirits they have encountered. Most of them keep small totems of friendly spirits and might even use one of these items as an implement. When in need, they can call forth these spirits to fight at their sides. When the spirits manifest in the real world, they appear as animals of their kind, but seeming almost feral, with gleaming eyes and wisps of mist curling from their bodies. The spirits can remain for only a short time before the magic that brought them forth unravels. Further, if they die in the real world, it takes time for them to re-form in the spirit world, so most spiritcallers dismiss their allies when they are in serious jeopardy.
