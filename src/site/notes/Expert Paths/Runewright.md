The practice of painting runes on technological devices originated in Lij and has since slowly spread to the rest of the Nine Cities as the various autarchs seek new ways to protect their holdings from potential aggression. In addition, the few remaining dwarfen holdfasts have experimented with this technique to better fight against the enemies that beset them at all sides. And, there are always those independents who have stumbled across the techniques and have made the study of this magic their life’s work.
Runewrights discovered that they could enhance the objects created by their Technomancy spells by painting eldritch runes on their surfaces. Although such innovation is hardly new, runewrights have found ways to coax more power out of the runes they create.
As a result, the flames they cast burn brighter, the bombs they build explode with greater force, and the blades they fling land with startling accuracy.

| 1   | You learned the runewright’s techniques from a master in Lij.                                                                                                                                     |
| 2   | You had an epiphany after you painted a rune on a device you created and instantly saw ways you could combine your favored traditions.                                                            |
| 3   | You found a manual containing diagrams and instructions for building wondrous devices.                                                                                                            |
| 4   | You pitched in to aid dwarfs in defending one of their ancient citadels from a troglodyte attack. For your assistance, the dwarfs taught you the secrets of drawing runes.                        |
| 5   | You came upon the corpse of an engineer, and on his body you found tools and brushes, along with several incantations that showed you a new way to cast your spells.                              |
| 6   | Having faced danger, you turned to Rune magic as a way to shield yourself from harm. The runes you etch and paint provide you with protections that virtually ensure you will never suffer again. |
