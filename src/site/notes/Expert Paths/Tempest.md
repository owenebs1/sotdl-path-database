In the last year, a new sort of spellcaster has appeared in the lands of RÃ»l, one whose skin turned to steel and on whose body lightning danced. This pioneering magic-user spawned more of his kind as he taught the secrets of the power contained in both Metal and Storm magic to his apprentices. Since then, these dangerous individuals, called tempests, have brought to bear a new force in the fight against the growing darkness, one that displays steely resolve and the fury of the most dangerous storms.
Tempests learn to enhance their castings of Storm spells by transforming themselves into beings of living steel. In this form, they can harness even more energy than before and direct it out from themselves with tremendous force.
Many tempests are as wild as the storms they control and are given to sudden outbursts of violence.
