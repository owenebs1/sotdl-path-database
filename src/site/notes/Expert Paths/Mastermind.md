You occupy the center of an enormous web of connections and relationships you have built in the course of your career. Rather than venture out into uncertain places and face unknown dangers, you rely on agents and operatives to undertake missions for you. Often, you do this because other concerns keep you too busy for a jaunt into peril, but your reluctance to leave the safety of your operation might also stem from your importance, position, or obligations. You remain interested in the efforts of the other members of your group, using your connections, influence, and operatives to help them succeed in their missions.

| 1   | You rose through the ranks of a criminal organization until you attained a leadership position.                                                                                         |

# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1.
**Languages and Professions** You speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Agents** You employ three agents, each of which is a player character you create.
The agents form a group with a level of 1. When your group level increases to 4, 6, 8, and 10, increase your agents’ group level by 1. As this group advances, you can choose any expert path for these characters, but if you choose mastermind for one of your agents, that agent leaves your service and you must replace them with another one; in other words, agents in your service cannot be masterminds themselves. These agents undertake adventures on your behalf and, so long as they accompany your group, you count as a member for the purposes of gaining benefits from increasing your group’s level. If you accompany your group, your agents must stay behind.
Your agents are loyal to you, carrying out whatever instructions you give them before undertaking an adventure. You can replace dead, missing, or retired agents, up to a maximum of three agents, whenever your group level increases.
**Base of Operations** You have a base of operations in a city or town of your choice from which you direct your agents. Work with the GM to describe the base. This location has accommodations for your agents as well as members of your group.
**Funding** Through businesses you control, you are able to maintain a rich lifestyle. At the beginning of each adventure, you gain 2 gc per level your group has attained to outfit and equipment your agents with equipment.
# Level 6
**Hidden Operatives** When your agents visit a community with a population of at least 1,000, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, you have 1d3 operatives in that community. Each operative can either provide influence, information, or security as the GM decides. Your agents can seek out the operatives for the assistance these operatives can provide.
**Extensive Preparations** At the beginning of each adventure, your agents gain Fortune if you are not present for the adventure.
# Level 9
**Plans within Plans** You have a pool of plans, which you can expend to help your agents out of difficult situations. You have a number of plans equal to 3 + your group level. You replenish your pool of plans when you start a new adventure. Once per round, you can expend a plan to do any of the following:
- Turn a failure resulting from an attack roll or challenge roll made by one of your agents into a success.
- Allow an agent to regain an expended casting of a spell he or she learned.
- Allow an agent to heal damage equal to his or her healing rate.
- Stabilize an incapacitated agent.
- Cause an agent’s attack to deal 1d6 extra damage.
