The clashing of swords, the whine of bullets zipping through the air, the screams of the dying, the oaths sworn and the angry shouts: the sounds of battle describe the chaos you have faced while fighting for your life. You have fought enemies to the death on blood-soaked fields. You have traded blows with skilled combatants and, more than once, feared for your life. It’s enough to make you wonder why you would ever fight again.
Rather than steer you away from combat, though, your experience in fighting taught you how to win, to spot vulnerabilities and opportunities and then capitalize on them. Based on your observations, you can come up with a battle plan to thwart your enemies and aid your allies. The orders you shout impel your allies to strike where foes are most vulnerable or can save the lives of your fellow soldiers. You are at the center of the action, directing your companions to where they need to be most.
You need a sharp mind to succeed at command.
It takes more than charisma or brute strength to adjust to the chaos in combat. If you are a warrior of exceptional intelligence, a cunning rogue, or even a magician, you can excel by following this path.
