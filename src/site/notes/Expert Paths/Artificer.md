Artificers push against the boundaries of magical research by merging science and magic into something new. Most artificers begin their careers as magicians or engineers, though anyone with a penchant for making mechanical wonders might pursue this path. Artificers learn to use their magic to piece together bits of gear to create useful devices, from armor to weapons, bombs to simple tools. Eventually, they can imbue spells in these devices to create even more powerful gear.

| 1   | You turned to magic to help you build the arms and armor you and your companions need to fight your enemies.                                                                                                        |
| 2   | You gained admittance to the Artificers’ Guild in the Free City of Lij and completed your training to become an artificer.                                                                                          |
| 3   | You stole a bag of spare parts from an artificer and discovered you had a talent for putting the pieces together to make useful devices.                                                                            |
| 4   | You found a complex magical and mechanical device. After extensive study, you began experimenting with making devices of your own.                                                                                  |
| 5   | You joined a heretical cult devoted to the Cog God, a mechanical deity sometimes worshiped by clockworks.                                                                                                           |
| 6   | You discovered the artificer’s methods quite by accident. You were pursuing another line of experimentation when the tools you were using suddenly and inexplicably assembled themselves into a new and useful form |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can either speak another language or add one academic area of knowledge.
**Magic** You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
**Artificer’s Bag** You have a bag filled with spare parts you use to create equipment you need. You measure the number of parts in gold crowns, though the parts are worthless to anyone other than you or another artificer. The gc value of these spare parts is equal to twice your group level.
You can use an action to begin assembling parts from your bag into a suit of armor, a weapon, ammunition, or an engineering item by spending parts from the bag with a value equal to the item’s price. It takes 1 minute to create the object, during which time you must concentrate and use a tool kit. At the end of this time, you have a finished piece of equipment that remains until you complete a rest, at which point it collapses into spare parts once more.
When you complete a rest, you replenish the parts in your Artificer’s Bag, up to your normal maximum value in gc. If you lose your Artificer’s Bag, you can create a replacement. It costs a number of gold crowns equal to your group’s level. You can have only one Artificer’s Bag at a time
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
**Store Spell** You can use an action to touch one object you created from your Artificer’s Bag. If you concentrate for 1 minute, during which time you must maintain contact with the target, you can expend the casting of a spell and imbue the casting of that spell into the object. The casting remains in the object until you complete a rest or until it is expended. Any creature holding the object can use an action to expend the casting from the object and cast the spell, regardless of the creature’s Power.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Magic** You discover a tradition or learn one spell.
**Mechanical Servants** You can use an action to create one or more [[Bestiary/Construct, Small\|small constructs]] using materials contained in your Artificer’s Bag. For each 1 gc in materials you spend, a compelled small construct appears in an open space within short range of you. You can grant the flier trait to any number of constructs by spending 1 extra gc from the bag for each construct you would make fly. The constructs remain until destroyed or until you complete a rest. At the end of this time, the mechanical servants collapse into parts.
