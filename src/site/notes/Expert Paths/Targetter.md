Flights of arrows soar through the air to rain down around you. You pluck one from the ground, set it to the string, draw back, and release. The distant cry and thud confirm what you already knew: your arrow found its mark. You have become an expert archer, and few can rival your aim, concentration, and precision.
The targetterâ€™s path might appeal to any character who favors the bow or crossbow in combat, as the talents it offers not only improve precision and rate of fire, but also a solution for enemies that come too close. The path can complement any fighting character, though, with a set of options to make combatants more versatile.
