Highlanders live in Rûl’s hills and mountains. These warriors often adopt fighting styles suited to the challenging terrain and wide-open spaces. Such individuals are accustomed to the hardships of their homelands and learn to defend themselves against the many threats that stalk them, from trolls and ogres to drakes and griffons. Characters who become highlanders might have begun their stories in these regions and eventually mastered the techniques of their people, or they might have withdrawn to these heights for a time and developed the techniques while living among the indigenous people.
