From the traditions of Protection and Rune was born a new method of using magic, one that imbues magical energy into sigils and glyphs to make them produce a specific magical effect when activated. The Banker’s Guild in Kem sponsored the development of wardscribing centuries ago and, until recently, restricted knowledge of the art to those admitted to the Academy of Magic, an institution created by the Vault for the purposes of protecting its interests and creating a cabal of magicians loyal to the powerful financial institution. No matter how guarded a secret might be, however, knowledge has a way of leaking into the world.
Even though the techniques are fairly widely known, few individuals make the effort to master them, because wardscribing involves considerable study and practice before one can flawlessly illustrate the sigils. One error, even the most minor one, can thwart the ability of the sign to hold the magic that brings to life the desired effect. For this reason, the people who know the craft are in high demand for their specialized capabilities.
Most who come to wardscribing already have some talent for magic, either from formal training or an inborn gift. Magicians are the most likely to pursue this path, though adepts (see Forbidden Rules) and some rogues might also take it up. Rogues who become wardscribes might learn the techniques to cover a retreat or as a way to get a better sense of the wards they might face. Warriors too could become wardscribes, especially those who value protection and defense more than offense and assault. Such warriors who become wardscribes began their careers as temple guardians, defenders of powerful magicians, or students of esoteric knowledge.

| 1   | While researching other kinds of magical lore, you stumbled across the secrets of sigil magic. |
| 2   | The development of sigil magic was a natural outgrowth of your magical studies.                |
| 3   | You learned from another master scrivener how to draw sigils and imbue them with power.        |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** If you cannot do so already, you can read and write every language you can speak. Magic You discover the Protection tradition or the Rune tradition. If you have discovered both traditions already, you instead learn one spell from either tradition.
**Learn Sigil** Choose a basic sigil when you gain this talent and another sigil every time your group level increases. You know how to draw each of your sigils using the Draw Sigil talent.
**Draw Sigil** Choose one of your sigils. You spend 1 minute using a stylus to draw the sigil on a soft surface such as dirt or sand or a writing kit to paint the sigil on a hard surface. When you finish, expend the casting of one spell you have learned to imbue it with power. The sigil remains imbued until something damages its appearance, the sigil is triggered, or the magic fades away (see below).
When you inscribe the sigil, you can do so in such a way as to exclude creatures of a particular sort from triggering its magic. The criterion for exclusion can be Size, descriptor, or identity. Choosing Size lets you exclude creatures of a certain Size or Sizes, such as 2 or smaller. Descriptor lets you exclude entire categories of creatures such as faerie, demon, or human. Finally, identity lets you exclude individuals whose names you know.
A sigil is triggered when a creature other than you that is not excluded from the sigil’s effect moves to a space within 1 yard of it. If you are within 5 yards of the sigil, you can use a triggered action at any time to trigger the sigil instead. Once a sigil is triggered, you resolve the sigil’s effects immediately.
The magic in an imbued sigil that has not been triggered fades over time. The amount of time it takes to fade away depends on the rank of the spell you expended to imbue it with power, as shown on the following table.

| Spell Rank | Duration   | Spell Rank | Duration  |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 0          | 1 minute   | 6          | 1 week    |
| 1          | 10 minutes | 7          | 1 month   |
| 2          | 1 hour     | 8          | 1 year    |
| 3          | 4 hour     | 9          | 10 years  |
| 4          | 8 hours    | 10         | 100 years |
| 5          | 24 hours   |            |           |
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Decipher** If you spend at least 1 minute studying text written in a language you cannot read, you can make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you learn enough to get the gist of what the writing says. Each use of this talent allows you to examine up to 200 words of text.
**Learn Advanced Sigil** When you would learn a sigil, you can choose to learn an advanced sigil.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Hasty Sigil** You have mastered the art of drawing sigils, such that it takes you just 1 round to draw a sigil instead of 1 minute.
**Learn Master Sigil** When you would learn a sigil, you can choose to learn a master sigil.
# Basic Sigils
Every wardscribe starts out by learning at least three of the four basic sigils, since they are the ones available at levels 3 through 5 in this path.
**Alarum** A loud ringing sounds from the sigil and continues for the sigil’s duration. Creatures within 10 yards of the sigil are deafened for as long as they remain there. The noise can be heard from up to 1 mile away.
**Dazzling Radiance** When this sigil is triggered, it glows with intense light that lasts for the sigil’s duration. When the light first shines, each sighted creature within 5 yards of the sigil must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane or become blinded for 1 round.
**Flames of Vengeance** When this sigil is triggered, roaring flames rush out from it to spread through a 5-yard-radius sphere and then dissipate; the magic of the sigil is spent immediately. The flames deal 3d6 damage to everything in the area, igniting combustibles. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success.
**Glyphic Protection** Shimmering glyphs appear on and orbit around the leading edge of a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil for the sigil’s duration. The glyphs impose 1 bane on attack rolls made by creatures outside the area against targets inside it and grant 1 boon on challenge rolls made by creatures inside the area to resist attacks from outside it.
# Advanced Sigils
The four advanced sigils are more powerful than their basic counterparts. They become available to a wardscribe at level 6.
**Confusion and Discord** A warbling pulse spreads through a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature becomes dazed for 1 minute and gains 1 Insanity.
**Crushing Terror** A howling noise spreads through a 5-yard- radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates.
Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature gains 1d6 Insanity and, as a result of gaining this Insanity, the creature becomes frightened for a number of minutes equal to twice its Insanity total. While frightened in this way, the creature must move away from the sigil on each of its turns.
**Mental Compulsion** A bright flash of golden light spreads through a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area must make an Intellect challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature becomes compelled for 1 minute and gains 1 Insanity.
**Waves of Lethargy** A soft blue light spreads through a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature becomes fatigued until it completes a rest, and while fatigued in this way, the creature is slowed. On a success, the creature becomes fatigued for 1 round.
# Master Sigil
Master sigils are the pinnacle of a wardscribe’s achievements. They become available at level 9.
**Crippling Pain** Lurid red light spreads through a 5-yard- radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature gains 2d6 Insanity. While frightened from gaining Insanity in this way, the creature is also dazed.
**Gibbering Madness** Mad laughter fills a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area must get a success on a Will challenge roll with 1 bane or gain Insanity equal to its Will score. If a creature goes mad as a result of gaining Insanity in this way, the creature rolls twice on the Madness table and you choose the result.
**Sudden Death** A wave of black energy spreads through a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil and then dissipates. Each creature in the area takes 7d6 damage.
**Swift Transit** The air inside a 5-yard-radius sphere centered on the sigil wavers for 1 minute. All creatures in the area when the sigil is triggered or that enter it before the effect ends are teleported to a single location of the GM’s choice 1d6 miles away.
