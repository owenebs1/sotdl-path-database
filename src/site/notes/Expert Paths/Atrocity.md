You return to the well of Forbidden magic again and again.
The temptation to learn and cast the most disgusting and gruesome spells ever devised to make your enemies suffer deliciously proves too great for you to resist, thus you have sunk into the quagmire of wickedness. The more you revel in the filth of this tradition, the more havoc it wreaks on your body, imposing appalling changes in your mind and flesh. Unstable and thoroughly deranged, you wield your magic with a recklessness that endangers everyone around you, but the injury and insanity afflicted on your companions is a price you’re willing to pay to attain the fullness of your potential.
