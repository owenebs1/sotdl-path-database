Collectors take body parts from the creatures they kill, wearing them proudly as trophies and drawing strength from them. Many collectors come from primitive cultures, of which their warriors display trophies to show their combat skill or their kill count.
Many squadrons of orcs developed unique trophy-taking traditions while fighting for the Empire, as have some elite human and dwarfen fighting forces.
Collectors from diﬀerent cultures display their trophies diﬀerently; an orc may wear a string of raggedly chopped ears still dripping gore, while a dwarfen collector is more likely found with polished, rune-carved claws set atop his helmet like a coronet.

| 1   | You lived for so long with nothing to your name that you developed a compulsion to collect as many things as you can, measuring your worth by how much you own.                                                                  |
| 2   | You derive pleasure from examining physical reminders of your victories, but each memory eventually grows stale, forcing you to seek new trophies.                                                                               |
| 3   | You trained in a warrior tradition that emphasizes the collection of trophies as a way of displaying prowess and experience.                                                                                                     |
| 4   | You joined a death cult that commands you to wear something taken from every creature you slay, out of respect for their sacrifices, to show your dominance over death, or to ward against the restless spirits of your victims. |
| 5   | You are part of a loose confederation of fellow collectors, and enjoy comparing your collections, boasting over your rarest pieces, and trading for new trophies.                                                                |
| 6   | You place no value on material possessions, caring only for the power your trophies grant you, and gladly discard an old piece as so much rubbish to replace it with something stronger.                                         |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Devour** You can perform a ceremony over the remains of one living creature you killed. You must complete the ritual within 6 hours of the creature’s death and the ritual takes 10 minutes to perform. If you finish the ritual, choose a body part from the Trophies table. The process of collecting a trophy, a combination of ritual preparation and careful excision, can only be performed once on a given creature.
To derive any benefit from the trophy, you must wear it somewhere it is visible. You can benefit from up to two trophies at a time. You can replace a current trophy with another, but if you do so, the power of the old trophy is lost, and you cannot use it again. If a slain creature does not possess a certain body part— for example, humans do not have claws, while a lash crawler does not have a breastbone—it cannot be taken as a trophy.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Impressive Display** You can benefit from up to three trophies.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Complete Set** You can benefit from up to four trophies.
If you have three trophies or more from creatures who share the same ancestry (for example, human, wolf, dragon, troll, and so on), the trophies grant you 1 boon on attack attacks rolls against creatures of that ancestry.
As well, while your trophies are displayed they impose 1 bane on attack rolls made by such creatures. Finally, the trophies grant you 1 boon on attack rolls to intimidate and taunt such creatures in social situations.

| Breastbone | When you take damage from a single attack and that damage would incapacitate you, you can instead choose to have the breastbone trophy shatter and take half damage as a result. Using the breastbone in this way destroys it.                                                                                                                                          |
| Claw       | Your attacks with your unarmed strike or natural weapons deal 1d3 extra damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Ear        | Each ear trophy you own grants you 1 boon on attack rolls made to intimidate and taunt in social situations or 2 boons if you make the attack roll against a creature sharing the ancestry of one of these trophies. Ears rot and become useless after 7 days.                                                                                                          |
| Eye        | You gain keen eyesight and your senses sharpen. For each eye trophy you display, you make Perception rolls with 1 boon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hand       | When you take damage, you can use this trophy. Roll a d6. On a 3–6, you reduce the damage by the number rolled. On a 1–2, you take extra damage equal to the number rolled. Each time you invoke this trophy, one of the fingers on the hands curls inward.<br>Once all the fingers and the thumb have curled inward, the trophy becomes useless.                       |
| Fang       | Each time you deal damage with a weapon, you can make the next attack roll before the end of the next round with 1 bane to cause the attack to deal 1d6 extra damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Foot       | For each foot trophy displayed, you gain a +2 bonus to Speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Jawbone    | When you prepare a jawbone trophy, roll 1d6 to determine the number of teeth clinging to the bone. When you or a creature within short range makes an attack roll, you can use a triggered action to grant 1 boon on the triggering roll. Each time you invoke this trophy, one of the teeth crumbles to powder.<br>Once all the teeth are gone, the trophy is useless. |
| Rib        | You have a +1 bonus to Defense against ranged attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Skullcap   | This trophy imposes 1 bane on attack rolls against your Intellect or Will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
