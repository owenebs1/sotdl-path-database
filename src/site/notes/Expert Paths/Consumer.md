Consumers break the taboo against eating the flesh of the fallen. Eating the body parts of their slain foes lets them gain a measure of their power and knowledge.
Some consumers see absorbing the potency of the defeated as the fastest way to power, some are driven by long-ago trauma that manifests as a compulsion to dine upon their enemies, while others simply lack the empathy to understand why such an act repulses most right-thinking people.
To choose this expert path, you must be a living creature that can eat.
