Bounty hunters specialize in finding people who don’t want to be found. Whether chasing down fugitives from justice, runaway slaves, or outlaws, bounty hunters draw upon a range of skills useful for finding their quarry. They know the right questions to ask, the best ways to pressure people into cooperating with their hunt, and how to get inside the heads of the people they track. And when they find them, they can bring them down with sudden, overwhelming force.
Although fully capable of killing their prey, most bounty hunters tend to bring their captives back alive, because the pay is better for returning them that way.
Warriors and rogues are the most likely to become bounty hunters. Warriors have the durability to face down tough quarry, while rogues have the skill and cunning to outwit their prey. Magicians and priests might become bounty hunters, their magical abilities becoming a critical asset when on the hunt.
