Gangsters, thugs, muggers, and worse, lawbreakers willfully embrace their criminal propensities. Some lawbreakers work as independents, taking what they want, whenever they want it. Others work for crime lords, criminal organizations, street gangs, and the like, lending their muscle to jobs, breaking legs as needed, or carrying out executions when their bosses give the order.
Lawbreakers might be a distasteful sort, their actions despicable, but they can handle themselves in a fight, making them useful additions to almost any group.
