Prowling the wastes of the Blasted Lands, the Ice Apostles display their disdain for the wider world, preferring the chill, barren expanse to the comforts found in the north. They believe their faith sustains them and, to some extent, protects them from the biting wind and slashing ice. Crazed servants of Old Man Winter, the Ice Apostles have proven themselves worthy of their god’s gifts, earning incredible power over the elements and carrying winter with them wherever they go. Like lesser priests, Ice Apostles tend to be a bit unhinged and given to savagery, raiding, looting, and killing as they bring the winter north with them.
