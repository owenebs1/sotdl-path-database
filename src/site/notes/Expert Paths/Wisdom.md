Standing outside the major faiths in the lands of Rûl, witchcraft lacks the orthodoxy one might expect from an established faith. Many different factions separate witches from one another. Some practice their faith alone, while others form covens for fellowship and to grow their understanding of what the Lord and Lady wish for them. Although the particulars vary, witches follow one of three paths: the left-hand path followed by [[Expert Paths/Maleficant\|malificants]], the right-hand path followed by wisdoms, and the middle path, followed by most [[Expert Paths/Witch\|witches]].
Followers of the right- hand path practice white magic, which they use to promote health and healing, to help others, and to steer people away from wickedness. Wisdoms might serve a community, acting as midwives, healers, advisors, and, when danger threatens, protectors. However, a few leave behind the responsibilities of their towns and villages and use their talents to help everyone they can.
