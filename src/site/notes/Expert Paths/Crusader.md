Those devotees who hear the New God’s call to arms against the growing darkness take up the mantle of crusaders and become merciless slayers of the enemies of their faith. With certainty on their side, with no room for doubt in their minds, they pit themselves against demon and cultist, heretic and necromancer without hesitation. Crusaders know what’s at stake if they should fail, so they never relent in their mission to purge the world of the darkening shadow.
