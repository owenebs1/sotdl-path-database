The secrets of elemental magic come from the genies, those crazed and unpredictable entities found haunting the most desolate lands in the world.
That knowledge has been passed down through the generations, subtly altered to suit the needs of the magic-users who learn the art. Sometimes, this haphazard learning produces entirely new strains of magic, often resulting from combining elements from two or more traditions. Blizzard mages, for example, have discovered how to merge the magic of Air and Water into an entirely new discipline, giving them power over cold and ice.
Many blizzard mages come from the ranks of other elemental casters, their specialty reflecting a new branch of study. Others might be devotees of Old Man Winter who have striven to master the forces their patron deity represents in order to better serve his interests in the world. And there are those who stumble onto the art, perhaps having uncovered the techniques from a relic they have found or a fortunate mishap resulting from a miscast spell. Whatever the source of their power, they prove to be deadly combatants, with the full might of winter in their arsenals.
