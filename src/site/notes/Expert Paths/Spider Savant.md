The Spider Wood has always been known for its spiders long before the arachne ever settled in the jungle. Here, spiders grow to enormous size and possess capabilities far beyond those of ordinary varieties. While many of these giant spiders are dangerous to people, many avoid humans and their ilk, instead preying on birds, rodents, and even other spiders.
Spider savants have a strange affinity for spiders of all kinds and can safely handle and interact with them.
Their ability often comes from the knowledge they possess of Primal magic, but it can also be a gift from gods of the wild places and dark patrons who adopt these creatures as their favored children. Spider savants take big spiders as their companions and, in time, are changed by them.
