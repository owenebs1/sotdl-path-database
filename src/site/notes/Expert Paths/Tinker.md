With a set of tools, a few parts, and a light application of magic, you create wondrous devices and objects imbued with magic that are capable of producing a variety of effects. Technomancy is the primary magic tradition that enables you to practice your craft, as the fundamental inner-workings of its spells provide you with the knowledge to construct long-lasting magical devices. At the start of the path, you cannot always predict what properties your creations will have, but with time and experience helps, you can attain mastery of the techniques you’ve learned, allowing you to build with efficiency and precision.

| 1   | A toymaker, engineer, or some other person with knowledge of clockwork mechanisms and tinkering taught you everything you know.                                                           |
| 2   | You became fascinated with tinkering after you discovered an unusual device whose purpose and function escaped you. You hope to solve the riddle of the device by developing your skills. |
| 3   | Your talents as a tinker grow out from your interest in Technomancy. The devices you create represent your efforts to master your tradition.                                              |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You speak another language or add another area of scholarship to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Technomancy tradition or you learn one spell.
**Bits and Bobs** You have a bag filled with spare parts and scraps that you use to assemble your wondrous devices. The bag and its contents are worthless to anyone other than you or another tinker. If you lose your bag, you can replace it. The bag counts as an uncommon item worth 1 gc.
**Wondrous Devices** If you have a tool kit, you can use an action to start creating a wondrous device. You must concentrate for 1d6 minutes, during which time you use your tools to assemble the item from materials you carry on your person. When you finish, you create a random enchanted object (using the tables in Shadow of the Demon Lord). The object remains until you complete a rest, at which point it crumbles into spare parts, which you can then return to your bag. You choose the form the object takes, but the GM randomly determines its property. You can have a number of enchanted objects from this talent equal to 1 + your Power score at a time. If you exceed this number, you lose an enchanted object created by this talent of the GM’s choice.
