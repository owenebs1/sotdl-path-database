The devils seek to corrupt, the faeries to enslave, and the trolls to destroy: these are all the enemies of any who are mortal, and you have taken up the challenge of destroying them all, even at the cost of your life. Your hatred for the immortals drives you, pushes you ever onward to soak your blade in their blood and cleanse the world of their scourge. Your hatred burns so hot that you can push through their confounding magic and blight their bodies with each strike of your blade.
So long as you live, every immortal you meet will die.
