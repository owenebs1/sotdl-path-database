Scouts possess a number of talents to help them sneak ahead, gather crucial information, and slip away without risk of being detected. In groups, they shoulder the burden of ranging ahead alone, moving from shadow to shadow, hardly making a sound, as they venture into unknown dangers to find out what lies in wait. As dangerous as their methods can be, scouts rely on their keen senses and good instincts to anticipate trouble before it comes calling.
Should they find themselves in a tough spot, they can usually slip away to get help in dealing with the danger they uncovered.
Skills, cunning, and luck enable scouts to do what they do and thus many scouts begin their training as rogues. The tricks and talents they gain as rogues serve them well when slipping off to chart a course ahead. Many warriors find the scoutâ€™s path appealing since it lets them diversify their talents beyond trading blows on the battlefield, and they have the toughness to take a few hits if the situation goes wrong. Priests of the Old Faith might follow this path because the talents are useful for protecting their territory and monitoring its borders for enemy movement.
