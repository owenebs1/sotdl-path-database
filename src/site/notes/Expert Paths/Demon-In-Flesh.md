The demonologists of Gog perfected techniques for summoning and binding demons. When not trapping them in items or fixing their forms into monstrous shapes, they experimented with merging the demons with mortal hosts. A merging prevented the demon from exerting control over the host, while affording the creature that carried the demon with numerous advantages. You have become a demon-in-flesh and the fiend residing in you clamors to be free.
You must be living and mortal to choose this expert path.
