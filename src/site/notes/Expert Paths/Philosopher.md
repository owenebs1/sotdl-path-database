Philosophers have done more to advance the understanding of the self, reality, and existence than any other in the lands of Rûl, certainly more than the priests whose own interpretations rely on service and devotion to distant deities. Through introspection and examination of the world around them, philosophers have laid the foundations of science, alchemy, ethics, logic, and more, and they continue to seek truth and wisdom in a world that largely seems to have gone mad. These free-thinkers are often found in the bustling metropolises, where they work to “corrupt” the youth by opening their minds to the mad hermits who root around in the wild, looking at things and reflecting on their natures.
Being keepers of wisdom and pioneers of thought occupies many philosophers for the entirety of their lives, but Urth’s magical and unpredictable nature causes reality to conform to mortal belief and expectation. Thus do many philosophers discover the world changes to reflect their understanding, shaped by the sheer force of their intellect, and see it as their duty to impose order on a world whose true meaning can never be ascertained. Such people travel widely, lending their expertise and knowledge to those who share their ultimate aims.
