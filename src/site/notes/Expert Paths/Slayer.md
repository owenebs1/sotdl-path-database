When you came out of it, the trauma from the experience reshaped your way of seeing things, turning you into an unrepentant killer.                                                                                                               |
| 2   | No one would ever mistake you for a good person. You like hurting others. It makes you feel as if you have power. Luckily, your companions can point you in the direction of people who deserve your attentions.                                                                                           |
