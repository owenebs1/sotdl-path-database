Despite the many advances in ballistics, firearms remain crude and unreliable. Some researchers, however, see the promise of the design and work to develop these weapons beyond their primitive origins. You are a gunsmith, and when you’re not out killing monsters and fighting demons, you’re at your best in your workshop tinkering with designs for new weaponry.

| 1   | The dwarfs taught you the secrets of black powder, and from their instruction you began to improve on their designs.                               |
| 2   | You blew up your workshop during an early experiment. Even though the explosion killed your favorite apprentice, you have moved forward undaunted. |
| 3   | You spent time fighting the orcs in Caecras and learned much about building explosives from the other partisans.                                   |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase both by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Languages and Professions** Add chemistry or gunsmithing to your academic areas of scholarship.
**Gun Repair** You can spend 1 hour working with a tool kit to repair a broken pistol or rifle. You must use uncommon raw materials worth half the weapon’s price. When you finish, the weapon is repaired and functional.
**Jezail** You can create a personalized rifle called a jezail. It takes a total of 24 hours of work, during which time you use a tool kit to assemble common materials worth 2 gc. When you finish, you have a working model, which has the properties of a typical rifle but requires special ammunition (see Advanced Munitions below). The weapon imposes 3 banes on attack rolls made with it by creatures other than you.
**Advanced Munitions I** You can craft special ammunition for your jezail. It takes 1 hour working with a tool kit and uncommon materials worth 5 ss to produce one of the following options.
- 10 bullets
- Breaching round
- Buckshot
- Dragon’s breath
*Breaching Round:* If you make an attack roll with the jezail against a target object within your reach, the target automatically takes 15 damage.
*Buckshot:* Your attack with the jezail deals 2d6 extra damage, but only to creatures.
*Dragon’s Breath:* You take 1 damage from the backblast as the weapon fires into a 5-yard-long, 1-yard- wide line to deal 3d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane and takes half the damage on a success.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Advanced Munitions II** You can craft additional kinds of special ammunition for your jezail. You can choose the following options in addition to those from Advanced Munitions I.
- 5 armor-piercing rounds
- Corrosive shot
- 5 dart rounds
- Explosive round
- Flare round
- Silent shot
***Armor-Piercing Rounds:*** When you attack with your jezail using this ammunition, you make the attack roll against the target’s Agility instead of its Defense.
***Corrosive Shot:*** When loaded with this ammunition, the jezail’s range drops to medium. Any creature that takes damage from this shot takes 1d6 extra damage, plus 1d6 damage at the end of each round for 1 minute.
***Dart Round:*** You can load each round with a dose of poison, a potion, or some other substance and apply it to the target of your attack.
***Explosive Round:*** When loaded with this ammunition, the jezail’s range drops to medium. When you fire it, the backblast deals 1d6 damage to you, and you choose one point within range. The fired round explodes in a 3-yard radius when it arrives at that point or impacts against a solid surface before then, dealing 3d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success.
***Flare Round:*** When you fire the weapon, choose a point within range. When the fired round reaches that point or impacts against a solid surface before then, it sheds bright light in a 10-yard radius and turns darkness into shadows 10 yards beyond the lighted area. The flare drifts to the ground at a rate of 10 yards per round until it lands and gutters out.
***Silent Shot:*** Attacks loaded with this ammunition deal half damage. The sound from firing the weapon carries just 5 yards.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Grenade Launcher** You build a grenade launcher and add it to your jezail. The launcher has the reload and misfire properties. You can use an action to attack with the grenade launcher while holding the jezail equipped with it. You take 2d6 damage from the backblast.
The launcher then lobs the grenade (or some other grenade-like object) to a point you choose within long range. The grenade explodes when it reaches that point or impacts against a solid surface before then, exploding in a 10-yard radius that deals 6d6 damage to everything in the area. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success, or also falls prone on a failure. When you gain this talent, you start with one grenade. You can build additional grenades for 20 ss and 1 hour of work with a tool kit each.
