Itchy feet, a preoccupation with what’s over the next hill, an obsession with seeing new lands and meeting people: these are just some of the excuses nomads offer when they pick up and leave. The truth is that it doesn’t matter why they leave. They just do.
Nomads drift from place to place, never letting the dust settle on their shoes. These are more than just hobos and tramps; their overwhelming need to keep moving translates into considerable tactical options that keeps them out of trouble in a fight. Nomads always stay a step ahead of their foes.

| 1   | You were part of a nomadic tribe and your talents demonstrate your culture’s influence on your development.                                                      |
| 2   | You lost people important to you and haven’t been willing or able to settle down lest you have to confront your grief.                                           |
| 3   | You’re looking for something out there in the world and you’re not going to stop looking until you find it.                                                      |
| 4   | You’re running from someone. They’ve been chasing you for some time now and you know that if you stop they’ll catch you.                                         |
| 5   | You have incurable wanderlust. You simply can’t stay put. Sometimes you feel bad for the people you leave behind, but you know they are better for your absence. |
| 6   | A hag cursed you. If you spend more than three nights in the same place, roots spring up from the ground to strangle the life out of you.                        |
