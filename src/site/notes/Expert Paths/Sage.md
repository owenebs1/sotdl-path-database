Sages are scholars, historians, intellectuals, and teachers. They amass information related to their fields of expertise, seeking to know everything about those subjects. Most sages live their lives surrounded by heaps of books and scrolls, but some venture out to find more knowledge in the world. Sages who brave the unknown find they often have the wit to ascertain the best solution to whatever problem they encounter.
Anyone with an interest in knowledge and learning can profit by becoming a sage. Most sages who leave the comforts of scholarship began their careers as rogues who dabbled in magic or developed talents that depend on intelligence.
Some magicians abandon magical research to advance in understanding of different subjects, while cloistered priests find joy and solace in books and scrolls. Warriors seek knowledge and wisdom to balance the body and mind, and to learn interesting and cunning combat techniques.
