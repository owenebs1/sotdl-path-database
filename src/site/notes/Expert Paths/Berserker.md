A vital energy for those in the thick of battle, anger enables a combatant to push through extreme pain and injury in order to return it twofold to those who dealt it. For berserkers, anger is more than just an emotion: it is a living thing always raging within them, desperate to be unleashed, always rattling the cage of self-control containing it. So when a berserker’s temper slips—even by a little—all the rage, hatred, and frustration boils out to transform the warrior into a wild killer, a bloodthirsty brute seeking nothing but the utter destruction of any foe who dares to stand before them.
The transformative power of a berserker’s rage might come from a variety of sources. Many are simply unbalanced, having witnessed so many awful things that they now snap under the pressure. Some have divine or supernatural causes for their anger; for example, dwarf berserkers believe they are taken over by one of their ancestor spirits. Others might be haunted by spirits or, worse, demons, and when they surrender to their anger, the entity haunting or possessing them takes over.

| 1   | You are possessed by a minor demon. You can keep it under control most times, but in a fight, it struggles to break free and take control. You might have become possessed after handling a demonic relic, encountering a demon in battle, or being subjected to strange magic. |
| 2   | An abundance of pain, death, and horror tax your mind to the point of breaking, so that when you come under intense pressure, you snap, becoming a deadly killer.                                                                                                               |
| 3   | A spirit, perhaps one of your ancestors, dwells within you and, when you are endangered, takes over your body to help you survive. You have spotty memories of what happens when you go berserk.                                                                                |
| 4   | You have always had a bad temper, but now it’s nearly ungovernable. Any provocation can make you enraged and you lose all restraint and free will when in the grips of your rage.                                                                                               |
| 5   | You wronged a hag, witch, or some other powerful supernatural creature, and were cursed by them as a result. Now, whenever you fight, the curse turns you into a brutal, unrestrained killer.                                                                                   |
| 6   | You hope to earn a place at the gods’ table in the afterlife by seeking a glorious death. In battle, your eyes go wild and froth flecks your lips as you cleave through your foes in anticipation of the end you crave.                                                         |
