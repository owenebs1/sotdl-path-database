You thrive in conflict. In it, you pit your talents against those of your enemies. Once swords leap from sheathes and arrows find themselves nocked on taught bowstrings, you throw yourself into motion, slipping through and around, over and under your opponents. You wrench weapons from fumbling fingers and drive them into nearby assailants even as you twist away to set up your next strike. You’re hard to pin down and no one can predict what you’re going to do next.

| 1   | You have a sharp mind and look constantly for ways to gain an edge in battle.                                                                               |
| 2   | You rely on trickery to win. You’re constantly feinting and dodging to create openings for your next strike.                                                |
| 3   | Something in your background made it unlikely for you to become a combater, but your unconventional experience helps you thwart your enemies’ expectations. |
# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase both by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Combat Tactics** When you take a turn and have no combat dice results, immediately roll a number of combat dice, which are d6s, equal to your group level. Note the numbers rolled on each die. The numbers rolled permit certain activities under specific conditions. When you meet the conditions and perform the activity, discard the result. Once you perform an activity granted by a die result, you must wait until you take another turn before you can use another result.

| 1   | When you would make an attack roll, but before you roll the dice, make the roll with 1 boon.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2   | Before or after you use an action on your turn, move up to half your Speed without triggering a free attack.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3   | When an attack roll is made for a creature you can see, impose 1 bane on the triggering roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4   | When a creature moves into your reach, you move up to half your Speed without triggering a free attack.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5   | If you have a hand free when a creature you can reach attacks you with a melee weapon and gets a failure, you make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the target’s Defense. On a success, you take the weapon from the attacking creature and can use a triggered action to attack with it. |
| 6   | When you move or use an action, gain an action. You must use this action immediately or it’s lost.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
