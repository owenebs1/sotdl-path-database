Despite the efforts of the inquisitors and witch hunters—and, sometimes, even adventurers—dark magic remains a terrible threat to the world. There are always those willing to sacrifice their souls for the fleeting power it offers, the practice of which is almost always horrifying and corrupting in its effects. Among the worst of those who dabble in the blackest traditions are the occultists, for they make foul bargains with devils, offering up pieces of their souls in exchange for the power they desire.
As part of these bargains, occultists receive the service of lemures, damned souls sent from Hell and bound to the occultists as slaves. Desperate to be free from their diabolical tormentors, these lemures prove loyal and dedicated servants, knowing that the more they can push their “masters” farther down the path of darkness, the more favor they will curry with their true owners, in the pathetic hope of gaining some kind of reprieve from the torments awaiting them on their inevitable return to Hell.
Maniacally enthusiastic, these damned creatures delight in continuing their vile work, cackling with devilish glee as their masters inch closer, with each bargain made and spell cast, toward their own damnation.

| 1   | You were or are possessed by a demon. You either pursue knowledge of the dark arts at the demon’s insistence or as a desperate gamble to break the fiend’s hold on you.                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Frustrated by the limitations of other magical traditions, you hoped to increase your power by looking into dangerous places. Dark magic seduced you and now you cannot escape its clutches.                                                                               |
| 3   | You were once a devout servant of a religious institution, but after witnessing the horrors in the world and the gods’ impotence at dealing with the manifold threats, you rejected your faith and embraced the evil burning in your heart.                                |
| 4   | You scoff at the notion that some forms of magic are intrinsically evil—the instrument is neither good nor evil, only the hand that wields it. You explore the dark arts to gain a greater understanding of its power, but you have begun to fear its growing hold on you. |
| 5   | After encountering a vile user of dark magic and suffering from the hideous spells at his command, you decided to explore the dark arts to better protect yourself against them.                                                                                           |
| 6   | You just want to watch the world burn. Dark magic gives you the tools to realize your desires.                                                                                                                                                                             |

**[[Bestiary/Bound Lemure\|Bound Lemure]]** You bargained with the devils in Hell and bound a damned soul called a lemure to your service. It appears as a naked elderly man or woman, whose body is covered in weeping sores and filth.
The lemure can speak any languages you know, but it speaks only in whispers, incessantly mumbling vile and terrible things about those around you, and sometimes even you.
The lemure takes a turn on each of your turns and you decide what it does. If the lemure moves beyond medium range from you it disappears, instantly returning to Hell. The lemure also returns to Hell if either of you become incapacitated.
You can attempt to recall the lemure from Hell by concentrating for 1 hour, during which time you beseech the devils for the return of their foul gift. At the end of this time, make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you gain 1 Corruption and the lemure returns to an open space within short range. On a failure, the lemure does not reappear and you can’t attempt to recall it again until after you complete a rest.
