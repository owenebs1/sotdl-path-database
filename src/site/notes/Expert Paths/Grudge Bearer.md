The spirits of the Honored Dead demand restitution for every wrong done to the dwarfen people. Their priests exhort their warriors and champions to seek out the enemies of their kind and mete out justice, whether that means slaughtering every one of the chosen enemy, hauling back treasure promised to them, or carrying out some other revenge crucial to settling the score. Among the priests are those who take it upon themselves to lead these expeditions, to be living symbols of their ancestorsâ€™ wrath and strike fear in the hearts of their enemies. These holy ones are the grudge bearers and the depth of their hatred is magnificent to behold.
Nearly all grudge bearers come from the ranks of the Honored Dead priesthood and supplement their fighting ability with magic learned from the Battle traditions. Others might come to the faith later in life, having witnessed firsthand the horrors in the world as warriors, and subsequently finding solace in the teachings of their faith. Regardless of the paths they take to become grudge bearers, they stand as fearsome champions of all dwarfen kind.
Grudge bearers tend to be more militant than other divine servants and thus dress themselves for battle, carrying hammers and axes with which they can dispense justice for the wrongs done to their people. Some grudge bearers carry enormous tomes in which have been recorded every slight and every insult done to their people, while others chant a litany of names so they never forget their duty to their people and the vengeance they deserve.
**You must have the Honoured Dead as your religion to choose this path.**
