Clad in motley and armed with a razor-sharp wit, jesters live by making others feel foolish, telling shocking jokes, and by generally making a mockery of everyone and everything around them. Most jesters find places in noble courts, where they are permitted to speak their minds freely, exposing the foibles and failures of the courtiers and others who have found their way in the noble’s entourage. While jesters enjoy some freedoms when it comes to jesting, they tend to make many enemies, especially when their barbs jab a little too deeply. In such cases, jesters might find it prudent to exit stage right and take their act on the road.
