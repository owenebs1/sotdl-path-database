Thieves live by taking things that don’t belong to them.
They have the skills they need to do so without being caught in the act. They palm objects, lift items from people they brush up against, thwart locks, foil traps, and discover ways into places ordinarily forbidden to them. Although many thieves steal for selfish reasons or because they feel the need to do so, others develop the techniques to explore tombs, scour ruins for lost relics, or hunt down other thieves and bring them to justice.

| 1   | You are a stealer of rare antiquities, specifically items of religious import. Your thefts ensure that items of power rest in the right hands.                          |
| 2   | You joined a guild of thieves operating in a large city. You paid your dues and, in exchange, get a place to live, receive training, and gain a sanctuary from the law. |
| 3   | You spent time in prison and learned basic thievery from the person with whom you shared a cell.                                                                        |
| 4   | You never forgot the skills you had to learn to survive your childhood, and you find they have useful applications beyond lining your pockets with stolen coin.         |
| 5   | Your skills with prestidigitation masked your criminal interests. You might have genuine magical training or are just skilled at legerdemain.                           |
| 6   | Your background in burglary pointed you toward this path, and the skills you learn reflect your growing expertise in your trade.                                        |
