Those who traffic with demons find themselves sullied by the experience, their very souls stained by the corrupting influence of these foul beings. The experience destroys some, but those who have shown loyalty to the Void might make use of their inner darkness and manifest demonic traits by harnessing the evil in their hearts. Called demon beasts, these despicable and, often, insane servants of the Shadow brutalize themselves in their bid to become more like the demons they serve. As their bodies become more and more contaminated, so too does their power until they almost become demons themselves.
