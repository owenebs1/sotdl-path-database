Oracles develop a special connection with supernatural beings, learning to invite them into their bodies to gain a measure of their power and wisdom. These beings might be gods, as many oracles believe, or they might be spirits, the souls of the dead, or something else. Regardless of the true origins of these beings, each possession strains the mind, eroding the oracle’s sanity and mental defenses over time.
When in the throes of their possession, oracles manifest physical signs of the being within their bodies. The manifestations depend on the entity. Divine possession can cause holy writing to appear on the body or a tongue of fire to burn above the head. More sinister beings cause shadows to dance, horns to grow from the oracle’s head, or a foul stench to fill the air. No matter the form these signs take, they indicate something ancient and powerful resides within the host body for a time.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You angered a supernatural power and caused it to haunt you. You experience strange dreams and exhibit strange behavior, since the possessing entity never truly leaves you.                                                    |
| 2   | The entity that possesses you is a spirit that has escaped the Underworld or Hell and now shares your body. When you use your oracle talents, the spirit takes over your body.                                                  |
| 3   | Your magical research and experimentation let another entity into your body. This entity might be a demon, devil, faerie, or something else.                                                                                    |
| 4   | You have a strong connection to a god, a bond that allows the deity to fill you with holy power.                                                                                                                                |
| 5   | You believe you are a mortal vessel for the gods. They possess you to take a direct hand in the world. You feel it is a great honor to have been chosen and strive in all things to be worthy of the gifts you have been given. |
| 6   | A near-death experience opened your body to supernatural entities. You believe (or hope) these entities are the gods, but the things you sometimes say when possessed by these beings have made you question your beliefs.      |
