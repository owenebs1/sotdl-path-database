The mortal agents of Hell, having been seduced and corrupted by devils, work in the world to drag others into depravity by appealing to their dark impulses and urging them to work wickedness through false promises, gifts, and other enticements. In return for their work, hellions are promised an easier time when they must eventually face perdition and, perhaps, even win a place of standing in Hell’s sordid hierarchy. Whether driven by fear of what they must face in the afterlife or a commitment to the wickedness that led them astray, hellions exist to ruin lives and consign mortal souls to the fires of the Devil’s unspeakable realm.
