Adventurers in the lands of Rûl have more opportunities to win fortune and fame than do others. Risking life and limb carries a high reward, either from the coffers of desperate villagers or from forgotten treasure vaults discovered as part of fighting against the enemies of all living things.
Few adventurers have difficulty finding ways to rid themselves of their wealth: companionship, food, drink, and comfortable living can drain a purse faster than if there was a hole in the bottom. Further, gear needs replacing, lodging acquired, and countless other expenses eventually force the adventurer to take up arms and face danger once more.
Magnates, however, find other uses for their hard-earned coin. Rather than fritter away their crowns and shillings, they invest it in an enterprise. This enterprise, if managed well, can see their capital grow, keeping them in wealth and comfort between adventurers, while helping to pay for personal protection when they eventually answer the call for adventure again. In addition to a revenue stream, magnates also accumulate a number of contacts on whom they can depend as they move about the civilized world. These contacts supply them with material aid, information, or something else, based on their position and profession.
Any character might become a magnate, but it takes cunning to keep a business afloat. For this reason, rogues and some magicians are the most likely to walk this path.

# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Languages and Professions** You speak two additional languages and add a profession to your list of professions.
**Bodyguards** You have in your employ 2 [[Mercenary\|mercenaries]] who are utterly loyal to you and obey your spoken commands. The mercenaries take their turns when you direct them. If you cannot give the mercenaries orders, they instead protect you on their turns. If your mercenaries die, you can replace one or both before the next adventure begins.
As your group level increases, so do your mercenaries improve. Each time your group level increases, increase your mercenaries’ Health by 1. When you reach level 7, the mercenaries each gain the Combat Expertise talent from the warrior path. When you reach level 10, the mercenaries gain the Combat Mastery talent from the warrior path. Find both talents described in Shadow, page 58.
**Business** You run a business of some kind. Whenever you start a new adventure, roll a d20 and add to it your Intellect modifier. Find the total on the following table.
## Magnate Business Table

| Total      | Result                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20 or more | You were incredibly successful. Roll a number of d6s equal to you group level and gain the total in gold crowns.                                               |
| 10–19      | Business was good. Roll a number of d6s equal to half your group level and gain the total in gold crowns.                                                      |
| 1–9        | Business was bad. Roll a number of d6s equal to half your group level and gain the total in silver shillings.                                                  |
| 0 or less  | Disaster struck your business. You start with no additional funds and the next time you roll on this table, roll a d6 and subtract the number from your total. |
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Extensive Connections** Once per adventure, whenever you visit a town or larger community, there’s a chance for you to have a contact there. Roll a d6. If the community is a city, roll 2d6. On a 6 or higher, you have a connection in this city. The GM chooses the connection from the influence, information, and security options, as described in Shadow, page 207. This connection is in addition to any others you make in the community.
