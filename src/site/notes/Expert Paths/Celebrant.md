The god of pirates, known throughout Freeport as One-Eyed Pete, is an unconventional deity by any standard. Most theologians consider the god to be nothing more than a symbol for the debauchery and cruelty one can find among those who live by plunder and robbery. Pirates and sailors alike invoke the god’s name before a night of drinking, spit curses at him before going into battle—believing him too drunk to know which mortal roused his anger—and pour generous amounts of liquor into the sea to keep the mad god from swimming up from the depths to take his share of their spoils.
Celebrants come from the ranks of retired ship captains, usually those who were forcibly retired and now look for a way to keep their purses full of coin and beds full of lovers. Charged with keeping One-Eyed Pete at the bottom of the sea where he belongs, they wander the cities drunkenly, spitting dire warnings of trouble to come, while sticking out hands to passersby to collect tithes that will keep the mad god’s anger from falling upon their heads. They are an unruly, sordid lot, every bit as much trouble as the god they purport to serve.
Although the celebrant expert path speaks to the unusual cult of the pirate god, you can also use the path to model worshipers of other faiths. In particular, It works well for followers of Revel, who is an unruly and sometimes dangerous god. If you serve a different god, replace the traditions mentioned in “Magic” with those associated with your deity.
