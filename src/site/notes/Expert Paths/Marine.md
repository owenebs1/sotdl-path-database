Every vessel that ventures out across the seas and oceans faces peril. Beyond the waves and wind, the storms that strike with little warning, dark, terrible things lurk beneath the shifting surface and great ships crowded with maniacal and wicked pirates lay in wait to plunder the holds of those boats who fall into their clutches. For this reason, most ships employ marines to protect the goods carried and the sailors whose work defends the craft from the elements.
You have some experience fighting at sea. Likely, you did a tour on a merchant ship, but you could have been part of a nationâ€™s navy. Your time on the ocean taught you how to fight in close quarters, to be aware of your surroundings, and to be mindful for trickery and treachery. You become a battle-hardened shock trooper, able to take a hit and keep hitting back.
