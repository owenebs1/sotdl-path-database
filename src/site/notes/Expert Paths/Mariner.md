Expert navigators and sailors, mariners earn the respect of their fellow crewmembers by knowing all there is to know about travel on the seas. Mariners can read charts and instruments to guide a ship to the most far-flung ports, through the nastiest storms, and out of the maddening doldrums that leave ships becalmed. Mariners have the experience, courage, and skill to tame the seasâ€”or at least to survive when the waters turn against them.
Mariners most often come from the ranks of rogues and warriors, though some dabble in magic. Most mariners can find steady employment, since their reputations precede them whenever they come to port; a few have their own ships and thus chart their own courses to adventure.
