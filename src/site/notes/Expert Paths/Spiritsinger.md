Wherever the spiritsingers roam, they hear the songs of the Firstborne in the rustling of leaves, the babble of creeks, and the calls of animals. Some singers are so attuned with the land and animals that they can hear the hum of the Firstborne in the rocks and dirt, or even in the blood of a fresh kill. These songs not only recount the Woad’s triumphs, but also advice, news, and warnings to the tribes.
Spiritsingers listen to these songs and relate the meaning of what they hear to those who are not attuned to the music. Because the Field Without End touches the field of magic surrounding Urth, the spirit singer develops other magical abilities as they grow in ability, learning to weave magic into their own songs.
Through seclusion and meditation, spiritsingers learn how to open portals to the Field Without End. Spiritsingers with this ability are seen as spiritual leaders among the Woad, but they do not gain a higher station because of it.
Spiritsingers who leave their tribes rarely use their abilities to open a way to the Field to non-Woad. However, portents of the dark times coming have led some Woad to believe that they must change their ways, and do what they can to aid in the fight against the looming shadow.
While this path is typically chosen by Woad characters, it might be available to other ancestries with the GM’s permission. In these cases, use the following Spiritsinger Story Development table.

| 1   | Throughout your whole life you’ve been able to hear things that no one else could: whispers on the wind, voices in the rivers, and the songs of the Woad.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2   | While studying the ways of the Old Faith, you stumbled upon an ancient tome written about the first Woad, and from that you learned how to hear the songs of the Firstborne.                                                                                                                                   |
| 3   | Some Woad from the Hare tribe were selling lessons in spiritsinging in a town you visited. From them, you learned how to hear the songs of the Firstborne.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | In your travels, you stumbled across a dying member of the Wolf tribe on their journey to the Tribe of the Den. After giving him your water and sitting with him until he passed to the Field Without End, the Wolf Firstborne granted you the ability to hear the songs as gratitude for your kineness.       |
| 5   | A fascination with the beastmen drove you to find their true origin; the first clue led you to believe they originate from a hidden spirit world and you think listening to the Firstborne will open a door to this world. You learned how to hear these songs and gained a deeper understanding of the world. |
| 6   | You set out to become a druid, but your teachers claimed you could not listen well enough to achieve mastery. They sent you to live with the Fox tribe to learn how to listen, and you can now hear the songs of the Firstborne.                                                                               |
