The reen come from some other place, some realm beyond the ken of ordinary people and the knowledge of the reen and their intentions belong to but a small few learned individuals. Lucky this, for if more people understood the reen and what they do to carry out their mission, panic would topple the last bastions of civilization. The reen intend to colonize this world and an untold number of others and thus the people aware of this threat spare no effort to wipe out the invaders wherever and whenever they appear.
Reen scavengers might or might not fully understand the reen, but they recognize the value of the scrap metal and mechanical bits that survive the detonation marking their demise. These people scour the landscape for signs of the reen and plunder the sites for anything of value. The more machinery recovered, the more the scavengers realize the danger they are in and the true threat these invaders pose.

| 1   | You discovered an unexploded reen and dismantled it, harvesting parts from its machine body.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2   | The reen conquered your village and turned you into a drone, whose chief task was to maintain the reen scouts and machinery. You have dim recollections from this time, now that you have escaped, but you recall enough about the machinery to put it to good use. |
| 3   | You discovered a malfunctioning reen and altered its machinery to serve your needs. For a time, the machine gathered salvage for you, but you haven’t seen it for months.                                                                                           |
| 4   | You did not just discover reen technology, you became reen technology. You are a mix-match of mechanical parts and your devices are melded to your body. If they become damaged or destroyed you can repair them as usual at the end of your next rest.             |
| 5   | You found an abandoned lab, sprawled with crazed notes and crazier devices. You grabbed what you could and left before anyone could find you.                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | You were called by the gods to hunt down the alien and purge it from your world. Anything you deem unnatural counts as an enemy and you have taken to using the foes’ tools against them.                                                                           |

Characteristics Health +3, Power +1
Languages and Professions You speak another language or add engineer, tinkerer, or machinist to your list of professions.
Repair Machinery You can spend one hour using a tool kit to repair one construct or clockwork you can reach. At the end of this time, the target heals 1d6 damage.
Reen Device You constructed a device out of components harvested from a reen. The device functions safely for you alone; anyone else attempting to use the weapon must roll a d20 and on a 9 or lower, the device breaks and cannot be used again until you spend 8 hours repairing it with a tool kit.
The reen device counts as a two-handed ranged weapon that deals 2d6 damage and has the ranged (medium) property.
Modify Reen Device You can spend one hour using a tool kit to modify the weapon. When you finish, you grant the weapon a number of special properties equal to your Power score. The modification remains until you use this talent again.
- You equip the device with a plasma cutter.
	Use an action to cause a 3-inch flame to jet from the end. You can use the device as a melee weapon that deals double damage to objects.
- You equip the weapon with a pulse beam setting, which extends the range to long.
- You remove the safeguard on energy output, which increases the weapon’s damage to 3d6, but it gains the misfire property.
- You manipulate the device’s settings so that you can cause it to release an energy surge.
	Use an action to release the surge, which causes a blast of energy to emerge from the device’s end into a 10-yard-long cone that deals 2d6 damage to everything in the area.
	A creature can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success. Once you use this property, you must wait 1 minute before you can use it again.
- The device emits a dampening field that imposes 1 bane on attack rolls made against you from casting spells.
- The device creates an energy field around you for as long as you hold it. The field grants a +2 bonus to your Defense. If you attack with the weapon, however, you lose this bonus until the end of the round.
