Leading the savage cult of the Horned King are the Horned Ones, devotees steeped in the traditions of their deity and charged with safeguarding the beasts in their patron’s demesne. Most Horned Ones live little differently than wild animals, surviving in the wilderness and using their magic to give them claws and teeth to defend themselves. Others clad themselves in the gifts taken from the beasts they protect and at least consider giving a warning before calling upon the full power of their faith to rend their foes limb from limb.
