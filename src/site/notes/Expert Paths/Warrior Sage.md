You avoid conflict when possible as you hold peaceful outcomes as superior to violent ones.
Yet circumstances make some conflicts not only unavoidable but necessary. And when the situation draws you into a fight, you rise to the challenge and do all that you can to bring it to a swift conclusion.
Your methods rely on careful analysis of your opponents. You see where they anticipate your strikes and you learn from them. You learn from your errors and adjust your tactics as a result. Your opponent might be superior to you at the start of combat, but you become its master by the end.

| 2   | A monastery sheltered you for years and it was there that you learned the core of your fighting techniques.                                                                                                     |
