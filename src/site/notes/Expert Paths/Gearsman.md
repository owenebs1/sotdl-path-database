Members of the Guild of Engineering are the undisputed masters of the arts of Technomancy, known throughout Rûl for their incredible skills in engineering and magic. They can create anything from a simple structure to the mightiest war machine, and each creation is unique to its maker. Even more, they have the support of the Guild of Engineers to call upon, something vital to their dealings with the peoples of Rûl. They are not always welcome; Gearsmen often encounter problems from those close to nature or who oppose the Guild’s use of souls removed from the cycle of death and rebirth.
To be a Gearsman requires a fierce curiosity, a flexible mind, and perhaps a touch of obsession. Machines are not the only thing Gearsmen are known for—depending on their expertise they can manipulate mighty energies, command dread spirits, or foresee events. Combined with their skills, these occult powers make any individual a force to be reckoned with. But Gearsmen are rarely alone in the world; each is able to call upon fellow Guild members to assist them and their allies. Therein true power lies, the power of a shared community.
New Cogs who enter the Guild’s grueling training process quickly learn the foundational principles behind its wonderworking via the Calibers, groups of skills necessary to their very survival. Calibers are divided into three distinct studies. The Caliber Primus encompasses fundamental engineering principles and Technomancy itself. The Caliber Secundus encompasses matters of safety and the Protection tradition. Once the Primus and Secundus are mastered, each Cog chooses a Movement to join and the Caliber Tertius, their choice of a related magical tradition. Only then are they true journeymen and Cog Gearsmen in full standing.
