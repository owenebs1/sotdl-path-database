Long ago, the god of the seas, Oceanus, commanded a great following on Rûl, but as new religions appeared, offering less violent and destructive paths to salvation, the Sea God lost favor and faded from the land until just a few temples still stood. On the Pirate Isles and on the Kingdom of Sails, Oceanus maintains a greater following, since people there depend on the sea for their livelihood and fear the god’s wrath if he’s not appeased. Reminding the ordinary people of Oceanus’s power are the drowned ones, a cabal of priests every bit as dour and frightful as the god they serve.
As the greatest of Oceanus’s priests, the drowned ones receive power from their god after having proven their loyalty and devotion by surviving the rite of passage. In this cruel ceremony, candidates are brought out into the waters and, after extensive prayers and chanting, held under the water until they drown. Once their struggling ceases, the drowned ones pull the acolytes out and attempt to restore them to life. Those who waken join the esteemed ranks, and those who don’t are discarded.
Drowned ones do not exist in great numbers, for their god has largely fallen out of favor, and thus the priesthood finds it difficult to recruit new members.
Because of the barbarous initiation ceremony, few find themselves moved to risk their lives to serve such a cruel deity. The ones who find a place in the Sea God’s cult, however, receive respect and deference from anyone who sails the seas—for to offend a drowned one is to offend a god.

| 1   | You fell overboard in a storm, but a drowned one found you and hauled you to shore. You studied the teachings of the Sea God and joined the cult soon after.                                                                  |
| 2   | You were raised in the cult of the Sea God, possibly as a ward of a local priest or a child in a family who feared the god. Your beliefs ran strong, and you eventually found the courage to undergo the rites of initiation. |
| 3   | You converted to the cult of the Sea God after becoming disillusioned with another faith. Your studies under the god’s priests revealed a dark and twisting path to enlightenment.                                            |
