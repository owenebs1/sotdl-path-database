Guardians work to slow the tide of civilization to preserve those sites sacred to their beliefs. These devoted men and women acquire their magical abilities from an initiation into the deeper mysteries of the Old Faith, a ritual that strips away their sense of self to enable them to adopt different animal forms. Becoming beasts lets guardians work more closely with their charges.
while also conferring the claws and fangs of predators to rend their enemies.
Nearly all guardians have strong connections to the Old Faith and the Horned King, though some may have backgrounds in witchcraft.
