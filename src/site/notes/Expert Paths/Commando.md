Often found attached to military units, commandos train to conduct quick, brutal, and unexpected raids by striking enemy compounds, encampments, and supply lines. Such tactics require commandos to travel lightly, relying on speed and stealth to get in position and attack their enemies by surprise. When they close in on their chosen target, they fight to kill as much as to sow chaos, swiftly withdrawing once they have created as much of a disruption as they can before exposing themselves to any organized, heavy resistance.
Commandos freed of military obligations find that their talents remain useful as they make their way in the world. In groups, they often work with scouts and rangers, adding muscle to the forward observers in case they run into any resistance. If groups lack persons who can perform these functions, commandos can often step in to fill their roles, already adept at sneaking around and staying out of sight in order to obtain needed information and deliver it back to their companions.
