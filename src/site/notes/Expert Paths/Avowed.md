Although the fey have no true gods, the ancient beings who rule the hidden kingdoms, such as the Faerie Queen and the Goblin King, occupy a similar place in the faeries’ worldview. The great fey protect their subjects and inspire them to great deeds or despicable villainy.
Most faeries regard the great fey with wonder and respect, while a few become so enamored that they devote themselves fully to their patron, acting as agents, champions, and protectors. The avowed, so called because of the sacred oaths of service they speak before taking up the mantle of service, range far from the hidden kingdoms on their missions, traveling wherever they must to defend and further the interests of their patrons. Avowed are almost always faeries, but some impressive mortals have pledged service to one of the great fey and found their offers accepted.

| 1   | A noble deed you performed won you the attention of one or the great fey. As a reward, that figure raised you up to become a champion of the court.                                                  |
| 2   | Your tricks made one of the avowed look like a fool. Your cunning gave you a place in the service of a great fey while also earning you an eternal rival or enemy.                                   |
| 3   | You spied one of the great fey and instantly and permanently became smitten. You serve in the hope of one day winning your patron’s affections.                                                      |
| 4   | You found a way to contact one of the great fey and strike a bargain through shrewd negotiation. In exchange for your service, you gained the patron’s favor.                                        |
| 5   | You sought out the gods of the Old Faith and instead discovered one of the lords or ladies. You mistook (or understood) the being for a god and henceforth pledged your life to his or her service.  |
| 6   | Your hatred of trolls, orcs, humans, or demons led you to serve one of the great fey, hoping to grow your power enough through the fey’s gifts to be able to stand against your enemies and survive. |
