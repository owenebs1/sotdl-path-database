Swashbucklers bring keen wit, daring, and superior fighting skills to any contest and use these capabilities to great effect when squaring off against foes. What sets swashbucklers apart from others who fight are the tricks and maneuvers they have at their disposal.
A swashbuckler can move in such a way as to foil an opponent’s attack, while creating an opening in the same foe’s defenses. Quick slashes and strikes with a weapon drive an enemy back, while the swashbuckler twists away, deftly avoiding the counterstrike.
Techniques swashbucklers employ are most often found among individuals of cunning and grace, who eschew heavier armors and cumbersome weaponry.
Maneuverability proves an offensive and defensive edge on the battlefield. A fighter, for example, can withstand a great deal of punishment and recover from it quickly, but a swashbuckler avoids being struck in the first place.
Swashbucklers have a knack for insinuating themselves among the rich and powerful. Many were born to such status, enjoying all the rewards it grants, and developing fighting techniques by dueling with others of similar standing. Some swashbucklers earn a high place, having lent aid to a noble in a time of need or won the heart of an aristocrat. A few swashbucklers are dashing scoundrels, robbers who steal from the rich to give to the poor.
Whatever the case, swashbucklers are known to take charge, making friends and enemies wherever they go.
