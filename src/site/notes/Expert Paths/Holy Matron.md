The wisest and most devout members of the World Mother’s cult are known as the holy matrons, an elite society of women who have all borne and raised children before giving their lives to the goddess. With their familial obligations at an end, they work on behalf of the World Mother, traveling the lands to ease suffering and nurture the families they encounter, reinforcing the bonds of kinship with the goddess’s blessing. Holy matrons work to settle disputes, help people put aside their grudges, and foster peace wherever they go.
Most, though not all, holy matrons are women past their childbearing years. They carry the idol of their goddess with them and whisper prayers over it whenever they invoke her power. Although this is a strictly female society, the World Mother sometimes imparts the gifts she reserves for these devotees to men. Such individuals might be widowers who reared their children or who have a special connection to the goddess. Males who serve in this role are called esteemed husbands.
