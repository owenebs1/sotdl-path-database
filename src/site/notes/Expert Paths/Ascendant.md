A mysterious order of monastic philosophers claimed one of the rocky islands not far from the Kingdom of Sails and there built for themselves an impregnable fortress in which they train, meditate, and reflect on the nature of existence. Called ascendants, their methods resemble those of other sequestered mystic warriors, in that the fruits of their labor allow them to transcend the normal limits imposed by their fragile forms. Where they differ, however, is how they tap into the power of their souls and minds and draw mystical energy from both, which enables them to perform astonishing feats, move objects and creatures with thought alone, and find ways to overcome any threat they might encounter.
