The study of dark magic offers terrifying capabilities, but at the cost of one’s immortal soul. Each spell learned, each tradition discovered sends the student deeper and deeper into darkness until his or her body rebels and displays the hideous marks of darkness. For many, the risks outweigh the rewards, but for a few desperate people, the temptation proves too great to ignore.
Harrowers profit from the darkness blossoming in their being, and as they plumb the depths of foul magic, they revel in the power it offers them. Beyond the physical signs of their corruption, they also learn to seize upon the darkness staining their art and use it to their great advantage. Whether cloaking themselves in clinging shadows or hurling ribbons of black flames to scorch their foes, they embody the wickedness that consumes devotees of dark magic.
