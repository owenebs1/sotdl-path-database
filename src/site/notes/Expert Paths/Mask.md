Why be one person when you can be anyone? You change your appearance as easily as another might change clothes, able to remake yourself at a moment’s notice to keep your identity concealed. The source of your talents could be perfectly mundane, magical, or a combination of both. Your abilities help you become the consummate spy, enabling you to slip into places normally forbidden to you, and to cover your retreat once you’ve gathered the information or materials you sought.
