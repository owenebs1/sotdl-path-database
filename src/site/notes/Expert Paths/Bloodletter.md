Nothing can match the spray of hot blood when you strike true. The cries of your enemies, the weeping and begging, and the stink of their fear all have some appeal, but they don’t come close to the satisfying sensation of connecting a weapon with flesh. Your unwholesome desire for killing makes you a monster to some, but as the old saying goes, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.
Bloodletters favor close combat so they can revel in the carnage. Such fighting requires plenty of stamina to withstand the punishment of enemy attacks, thus making this path suitable largely for warriors and some priests. Of course, the path does provide opportunities for other characters to become a bit tougher and nastier in a fight, though at considerable risk to themselves.
