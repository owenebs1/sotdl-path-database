Invocation spells put a significant strain on the minds of those who cast them, since the magic draws forth the essence of another creature and binds it to the caster’s body. Many have sought ways to mitigate the difficulties of these spells, to keep their sanity intact, but few have found much success. Many of those few individuals are soulcatchers, who use necromantic magic to construct vessels to hold the daemons they summon. The undead vessels they create suffer no consequences from harboring these entities, which makes them an indispensable asset for those seeking mastery over the powers.
As with others who study the dark arts, soulcatchers tend to stand outside what others deem acceptable and count inquisitors and witch hunters among their enemies. Soulcatchers who come from religious backgrounds often believe that the daemons they invoke are messengers from the gods, while those of a secular origin might invoke the same entities for the sake of gaining power, knowledge, or something else.

| 1   | You found a talisman and deduced how to use it to call forth a daemon.                                                                                                     |
| 2   | Your mind was strained to the point of breaking from all your trafficking with daemons. You devised a solution that would allow you to control these entities more easily. |
| 3   | The body from which you made your daemonic vessel was once a mighty invoker.                                                                                               |
