Firearms might be hard to find, expensive to purchase, and dangerous to use, but you’ve made them your weapon of choice. You know how to build them, to maintain the ones you have, and you’re always carrying one or more somewhere on your person.
When you’re headed into danger, you wear a brace of them, so you can draw and shoot, draw and shoot, and on and on until you run out of firearms. When the smoke clears, only the dead and dying remain.
If you go on to choose the gunslinger master path, you can use the six-shooter gained from that path with your pistoleer talents.
