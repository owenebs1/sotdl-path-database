Father Death attracts peculiar people to his cult. Finding a place there requires a fascination with death and dying, a commitment to the cycle of life and death, and an opposition to anything that would subvert the proper order of things. Most priests of Father Death watch over cemeteries, ease the ends of the sick and dying, and guard against the undead and those who would create them.
Among the higher-ranked members of the cult stand the Solemn Ones, men and women who spend much of their time in quiet contemplation over the nature of mortality, communing with Father Death and visiting the Underworld in their dreams. When the cult faces a crisis, the Solemn Ones step forward to restore order and eradicate any undead by whatever means they have. Most priests follow this path after climbing through the ranks of the cult, but the religion makes exceptions for individuals who have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to Thanatos.
