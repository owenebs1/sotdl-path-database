The most scholarly of magic-users, wizards confront magic as a science, believing the field of energy enveloping the world obeys certain laws and principles. Only by rigorous study and practice can one ever hope to attain true mastery over magic. Thus, wizards spend years poring over the writings of their predecessors, experimenting with strange spells, hunting down elusive relics, and collecting bizarre ingredients they believe can open new areas of study and produce new magical effects. Most wizards consider all strains of magic to be fair game in their research, making them some of the greatest heroes or the darkest villains the world has ever known.
Wizards record their research and discoveries in a “Grimoire,” an overly large book, its size necessary to contain all of the arcane knowledge they have acquired.
It is these huge books that make their profession quite obvious to any who see them, for no wizard ever travels without one or more of these weighty tomes. As they accumulate more and more knowledge, wizards must create additional Grimoires, filling their libraries with countless volumes of incredibly valuable and powerful tomes.

| 1   | You began your training in a religious setting. You might have been apprenticed to a witch or served as an acolyte in a temple dedicated to the New God. You discovered early on that there was more to magic than your faith claimed, and this discovery has given you an appetite for more knowledge and power.     |
| 2   | Your academic approach to magical knowledge made it easy for you to expand your studies and learn new spells.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | You have a keen mind and an innate understanding of how magic works. You might have come late to the study of spells, but your quick wits and natural talent made learning them very easy.                                                                                                                            |
