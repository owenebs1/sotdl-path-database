One of the greatest threats to the Empire comes in the form of magical misuse, exemplified by the proliferation of dark magic and its unhinged users.
Each time a necromancer animates a corpse or an apocalyptist casts a Forbidden spell, the world grows a little darker. Now, the need to contain this danger has never been greater. While the Inquisition works to root out such evil and consign the villains to the purifying flames of their pyres, others have also seen the peril and have stepped forward to contain the darkness in the best way they can.
The Order of Magisters came into prominence a century ago in Lij. Although the city shows great tolerance for magic in all its forms, many magicians feared the spread of dark magic in their city and the horrors that its use could unleash. Committing themselves to tracking down and destroying these renegade users, the members devised special techniques to pierce magical defenses, while also protecting themselves from reprisals. The magisters have since spread out from Lij, but their numbers remain few and the task they set for themselves exceedingly dangerous. These men and women roam the lands, watchful for signs of dark magic, and work with local authorities to track the perpetrators down and destroy them wherever they find them.
