All magic bends the rules, but certain traditions bend them to the point of breaking. Time magic, for example, allows a caster to alter the flow of time and travel through it, while Teleportation spells remove the distance between points to allow speedy and sudden transit. Students of either tradition gain great versatility, but those who seek to master both disciplines find themselves poised at the precipice where reality ends, able to go anywhere and to any time they choose. Such casters gain the moniker edgewalker, since they tread the impossibly narrow path at the edge of all places and all times.
Anyone with a background in magic might become an edgewalker, though the path holds strong appeal to magic-using rogues, since the spells from the associated traditions help them with their schemes.
More traditional users of magic follow this path simply because they appreciate the utter importance of being in the right place at the right time.

| 5   | You witnessed a tear in reality that gave you a glimpse of a terrible future you now hope to change.                                                                                                   |

**Magic** You discover the Teleportation or Time tradition or learn one Teleportation or Time spell.
**Instinctive Teleport** When you take damage, you can use a triggered action to expend the casting of a Teleportation spell. You teleport to an open space within a number of yards equal to 2 + the rank of the spell whose casting you expended.
**Time Leap** When you take a turn, you can use a triggered action to expend the casting of a rank 1 or higher Time spell. You step forward in time, seeming to disappear from reality until you reappear at the end of the round.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +2, Speed +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Temporal Disturbance** When you cast a Time spell or a Teleportation spell, you can choose to flicker in and out of existence, moving swiftly from one second to the next and back again until the end of the round. You impose 1 bane on all attack rolls made against you, and you make challenge rolls to resist effects with 1 boon. In addition, until this effect ends, you can move through solid objects that are no more than 2 inches thick.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1, Speed +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Edgewalk** If you use an action during a fast turn, you can move up to your Speed. Whenever you move, you can choose to edgewalk instead. When you edgewalk, time suddenly stops for everything except you, which enables you to move up to your speed in any direction you normally can move, ignoring the effects of moving across difficult or even hazardous terrain. Your movement does not trigger free attacks, but you cannot open doors or interact with any creatures or objects while moving in this way. When you reach your destination, time begins to flow again, and you appear to all other creatures as if you had teleported to your destination.
