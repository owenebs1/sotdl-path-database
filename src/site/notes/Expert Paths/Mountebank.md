Scoundrels, confidence artists, charlatans, and tricksters, mountebanks use deception and trickery to make their way through the world. Central to their talents is a deep understanding of what people want and what they’ll do to acquire what they want. After a few probing questions, a mountebank discovers a victim’s wishes, and then weaves a deception to manipulate that person.
To most, mountebanks are social parasites, opportunists of the lowest order. They feed on the fortunes of others, and give a litany of excuses and false assurances, as worthless as glass jewels, in return. Despite this poor reputation, mountebanks have the skills to open doors, gain access to important and powerful individuals, and grow personal fortunes. When a victim becomes suspicious, a mountebank has foresight enough to know to slip away to find a new target.
Most mountebanks come from the ranks of rogues, especially those with talents focused on manipulation and control. Such individuals find the mountebank path a way to develop and improve on existing techniques. A rogue with these skills can be a truly confounding opponent.
Others might choose this path. Failed priests turn to this path to make their way in the world. Magicians, especially those that have discovered the Enchantment or Telepathy tradition, can find being a mountebank complements their spells.
