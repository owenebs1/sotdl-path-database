Courtiers wage war in the halls of the nobility.
Though they fight with innuendo and gossip instead of sword and dagger, the stakes are no less high. With but a whisper, a courtier can shift the tide of opinion against an enemy and ascend higher in the court’s ranks. At the same time, courtiers must be vigilant against attacks by their rivals, who ply the same talents as they vie for their own space in the highest echelons of civilization.
Most courtiers pass their time in the halls of the rich and powerful, basking in the affluence of kings and queens, merchant princes, and, perhaps, crime lords.
Rarely do courtiers find themselves far from the stage on which they perform, lest they sacrifice standing and influence. At times, circumstances drag courtiers out from their cloistered realms and into the perilous world, where they must survive by wits and words.
Typically, courtiers come from a background of wealth and privilege—rare is the one who comes from common stock. Rogues find that the courtier’s life complements their training and talents, while magicians and some priests might find a comfortable place among the movers and shakers of the city.
