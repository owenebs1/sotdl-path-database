Whether they realize it or not, all mystics walk a path to enlightenment, a transcendence of the physical into the realms of the spiritual. Mystics discover within themselves a wellspring of power, an energy that comes from the soul called Qi. By harnessing this energy, mystics push past their limitations, moving faster, healing their own injuries, and fighting with preternatural speed and strength.
For thousands of years, individuals have sought the awakening promised by the path of the mystic. For most, it is a solitary journey of self-discovery, with long hours spent in meditation and training. Some manage to find master mystics who have turned away from civilization’s comforts to seek even greater enlightenment in isolation. In secluded temples, mystics gather to preserve the traditions that have been handed down the long generations. Within such temples, the residents might be convinced to teach what they have learned to others.
Characters from any background might become mystics.
Warriors have the training and durability to hold their own on the battlefield, a solid foundation on which they can build their martial arts. Priests who become disillusioned with the gods might seek answers beyond faith, discovering magic can come not from a distant deity but from within.
Rogues might seek to enhance their combat training, while magicians who become mystics effectively weave spells in with kicks and strikes.
