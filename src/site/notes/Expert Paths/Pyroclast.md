Beneath the surface of the world flows the hot blood of Urth. Pyroclasts can feel the boiling magma as if it were their own blood and burn with the desire to call it forth. Students of both Earth and Fire magic, they learn to harness these elements, combining them in their bodies to achieve greater command over both. When they tap into these fundamental forces, they transform into beings of superheated rock, eyes blazing and heat radiating from their bodies in punishing waves.
Pyroclasts first appeared in the world in ancient times, when the gnomes and salamanders joined forces to fight the trolls and their hateful armies.
Since then, pyroclasts have reemerged at various times, usually as a byproduct of discovering either the Earth or Fire traditions. Most pyroclasts find that their magic changes them, making them angry and more temperamental, prone to lashing out with little or no provocation.
