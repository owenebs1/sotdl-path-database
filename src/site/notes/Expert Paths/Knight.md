Knights have always held an important place in the Empire—in fact, exemplars of their skills and devotion existed in Rûl long before the Kalasans arrived. A breed of combatant bound by certain principles and expectations of behavior, knights were warriors paramount, being true champions of the lords and ladies they served. They proved their worth on the battlefield, clad in plate, armed with lance and shield, charging into battle astride powerful steeds. They could ride down infantry and skewer vile monsters with their lances.

And off the battlefield, most knights were paragons of courtesy and honor, their code of conduct guiding them through any situation. Even though new developments in arms, such as the emergence of gunpowder, threaten to make their kind obsolete, knights still roam the Empire’s lands, righting wrongs, fighting for the innocent, and dispensing justice wherever they travel.
While most knights are valiant and principled, not all are. Some knights are little better than mercenaries, selling their swords to whomever can afford their price, while others live as robbers, using their arms and fighting skills to take what they want. Then again, not all people who become knights have backgrounds in courtly training. Some might be noble warriors from primitive societies, fierce protectors who seek to right wrongs, or holy men and women who have taken up arms to fight in the name of their gods.
