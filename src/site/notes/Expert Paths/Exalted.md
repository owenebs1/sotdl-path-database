The gods rarely, if ever, show themselves to their worshipers; rather, these deities present themselves through the works of their servants, those priests, clerics, disciples, and other proselytizers who have given their lives to the service of the divine.
And though some devoted servants can perform miracles, working wonders of magic, even they rarely encounter their patrons. A rare few, however, develop a personal relationship with the divine and feel the hand of their patrons upon them. The gods shield them from harm and intervene on their behalf to spare their lives.
Exalted appear in times of great spiritual turmoil, such as when Astrid taught a new path or in the wars between the Empire and Blötland. Most exalted die as martyrs though, for the message they bring is rarely in accord with accepted doctrine, at least while they live.
Their deaths, though, become the necessary catalyst for a religion’s reform.

**Chosen of the Gods** An encounter with your deity elevates you above the other members of your faith, marking you as chosen. While you are conscious, you impose 1 bane on attack rolls made against you and you make challenge rolls to resist harmful effects with 1 boon. In addition, whenever you make a Fate Roll, you roll twice and use either result.

**Voice of the Gods** Your sermons can hold the attention of those who listen and awaken in them feelings of amity and religious devotion. You can deliver a sermon, which lasts 1d3 hours.

# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Wonder** You can call upon your god to intervene on your behalf. To do so, you must pray for 1 minute and expend the casting of one spell you have learned. The rank of the spell determines the miracle’s effect, as chosen from the following options.
- **Smite** For each rank of the spell expended, you gain 2d6 (or 1d6 if you expended a rank 0 spell). You can divide up the dice gained from this effect between any number of creatures you can see. A bolt of lightning strikes each target that has one or more die. For each creature, roll the die or dice and apply the total as damage.
- **Heal** For each rank of the spell expended, you gain 2d6 (or 1d6 if you expended a rank 0 spell). You can divide up the dice gained from this effect between any number of creatures you can see. Light suffuses the creatures. For each, roll the die or dice and apply the total as healing. You can expend 2 dice to neutralize one poison affecting a creature or remove disease from a creature. You can expend 10 dice to restore a creature to life.
- **Succor** You appeal to your god for protection. If you expended a rank 3 or lower spell, any number of creatures that you can see gain enough food and drink to sustain them for 24 hours. If you expended a rank 4 or higher spell, you and each creature you can reach transport to a destination sacred to your faith that you have visited at least once before.
- **Other** You can request a different effect, using spells of an equivalent rank to the one expended to determine the appropriate effect. The GM might alter the effect to keep it within bounds.
After you use this talent, you must make a Will challenge roll with a number of banes equal to the rank of the spell whose casting you expended. On a success, you must wait 1 hour before you can use this spell again.
On a failure, you glimpse the face of your deity, gain 1 Insanity, become blind for 1d3 hours, and cannot use this talent again until you complete a rest.
