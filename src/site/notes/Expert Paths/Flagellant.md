The spectrum of devotion to the gods ranges from skepticism to fanaticism, with the outlook of most people falling between those extremes. Flagellants go beyond even the norm for fanatics, having become convinced that their bodies and perceptions occlude the truth of existence and that the temptations of the flesh distract them from their true calling. To gain greater clarity, flagellants mortify their flesh with whips and scourges. The pain from the open, weeping wounds they cause helps them rise above lust, hunger, and thirst, enabling them to serve their deity as they believe they were meant to.
Though all religions have some extremists who engage in such behavior, the practice of flagellation is most common among those followers of the New God who see the physical body as being a temporary shelter for their immortal souls. The cult cracks down on these fanatics occasionally, at times deeming them heretics, but every generation of devotees seems to produce more of these unhinged faithful.
Most flagellants of the New God are natives of rural communities across the Empire.
