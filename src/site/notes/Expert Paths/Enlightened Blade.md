You understand the necessity of being adaptable in combat. You tailor your strikes and forms to the foe you face. When you square off against a single opponent, you work to counter its attacks and make swift attacks in answer. When faced with multiple foes, you adopt a more reserved approach, deflecting the strikes as they come in and then using your enemiesâ€™ numbers against them when you finally hit back.
