In ancient times, the Heralds of Endings would walk among the shuffling corpses, feeding on the necromantic magic flowing through them to bolster themselves against attack. Fearsome and mad, these Heralds preferred the charnel stink of their rotting companions to their own living kin, finding some strange sustenance from being among the dead. Since the original Gog Heralds kept to themselves, most believed their dark arts died with them. Fragments describing their methods have somehow survived in the Desolation and there are those drawn into the wastes to learn how to follow in their steps.
