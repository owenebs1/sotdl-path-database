The Queen of Spiders depends on her priests to carry out her will in the world and, eventually, secure her release from the prison that binds her. The people making up her priesthood tend to be too self-serving, greedy, and cruel to look beyond their own needs, and thus many invariably come to a swift and horrific end after earning their mistress’s enmity.
A few, though, manage to distinguish themselves through the constancy of their service and receive greater favor from their patron. These chosen find their willpower stripped from them until they become living extensions of their dark goddess, commanding dread magic, finding all others who follow the tenets of their faith unquestioningly obedient to the priest’s every command.
