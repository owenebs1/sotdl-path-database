Although the Shadow tradition does not fall under dark magic, it often attracts those who would exploit magic for diabolical ends. Whether they use spells to mask activities, to keep them concealed from the pure light of day, or to aid them in dealing with fell beings called forth from the Underworld or beyond, the people who practice Shadow magic often walk the narrow path between innocence and corruption, and many of those find themselves tempted to take up even darker expressions of magic.
One thing common to nearly all users of Shadow magic is a tendency to be altered by its nature, to become more comfortable in the twilit hours and darkness, while shunning the light. Silhouettes embody this tendency, for they are individuals who have sought to understand Shadow magic in order to abet their criminal activities. Though it is false to assume that all who become silhouettes are drawn to acts of thievery, assassination, or worse, the vast majority are, and the tendency is so widespread that most outsiders paint all followers of this path with the same black brush.
Becoming a silhouette requires knowledge of Shadow magic. It is not enough to learn the mystic words or gestures to walk this gloomy path, however; one must become as shadow, embracing the darkness and rejecting the light.
Learning the appropriate magic and achieving the proper state of mind ushers the student into a dark world of flickering shadows that bend to her commands. The gathered shadows can then be used to cloak the character in darkness, to cause her to vanish, or even to coalesce shadows into blots of magical darkness to confound her enemies.
