The Maiden in the Moon chooses young women with a talent for magic, welcoming her daughters into her arms and whispering to them the secrets of magic. These priestesses of the Maiden find refuge in secret places where the goddess’s name is not yet spoken in derision. A few Daughters of the Moon leave their convents and temples to track down lost magic and potent relics, and to punish those who dabble in the dark arts. Nearly all show their devotion to the goddess by marking their bodies with the sign of the crescent moon. This tattoo shines when the light of Tarterus falls upon it.
