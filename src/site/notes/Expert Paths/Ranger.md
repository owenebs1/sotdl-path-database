The first line of defense against the darkness outside the civilized lands, rangers prowl the wilderness, always on the move, never staying in one place for too long. Consummate survivors, rangers know how to get along in the wild. They know how to find water, what foods to forage, and how to hunt and trap game. Whether they climb the trackless mountains or stalk through the deepest forests, rangers are no more in their element than when they are in the midst of the wilds.
The ranger’s life is one of isolation. Many feel called to set out into the most dangerous lands, where they wage war against the monstrosities that pose the direst threat to ordinary people. Others have cut ties to their homeland, preferring to keep their own company to the crowds and stench of the cities. Most rangers see it as their duty to protect the natural places and those who struggle to make a life on the frontier, though some feel no obligation to the world, and might even join forces with other wild things to curb civilization’s encroachment upon the untamed lands.
Rangers come from all backgrounds. Warriors might become rangers after fighting monsters in the wild or blazing trails into unknown lands, while rogues might develop ranger talents after being outlaws or bandits forced out of urban environments. Many priests of the Old Faith and magicians focused on Nature and Primal magic become rangers to champion their gods or to deepen their connection to the natural world.
