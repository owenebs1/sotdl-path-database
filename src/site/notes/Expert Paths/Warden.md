Nature spirits individuals who have shown great respect and care for the natural world to be their champions, investing in them the power to directly channel the magic that permeates the land. Warden, as they are known, become avatars of nature’s fury. Many wardens live in remote places, deep inside primeval forest, atop the highest mountains, or in the center of vast steppes. Such wardens spend years in their chosen home, tending the land and guarding it from despoilers. When the shadow falls, wardens stir from their realms to take the fight to the world’s enemies.
