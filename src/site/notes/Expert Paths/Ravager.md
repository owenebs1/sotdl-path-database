Size, strength, and ugliness all contributed to the fearsome reputation held by the orc soldiers enslaved to the Alabaster Throne. What really brought rebellions and insurrections to end, conquered more lands to expand the Empire, and decimated the beastmen, pirates, and countless others was the ferocity of the orcs. They might not fight with the most skill or finesse, but their fierce dedication to savagery and mayhem has served them well against some of the best-trained warriors the world has ever known.
Orcs furiously charge their enemies, hacking and slashing, tearing and biting, doing everything they can to quickly kill or incapacitate them, and then immediately move on to the next victim—and those are just the ordinary foot soldiers. The most brutal orcs in the Empire’s service are the ravagers, warriors chosen from among the most vicious and murderous to lead the charge in battle or be the first to storm the walls.
Ravagers fall somewhere between being as disciplined as fighters and as deadly as berserkers. Unlike fighters, they don’t specialize in specific techniques; unlike berserkers, their fury does not rule them. While ravagers are most commonly found among the orcs, almost any people in lands where hardship and violence are common might see them in their ranks.
Warriors are the most likely to become ravagers, though some priests, such as those devoted to the Horned King or gods of war, adopt this path as an expression of their faith. Ravagers from other paths do exist but are quite rare.
