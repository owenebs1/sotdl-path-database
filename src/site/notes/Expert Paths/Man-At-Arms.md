Men-at-arms, despite the name, encompass a variety of capable warriors—of any gender—who are heavily armed and fight from the backs of mighty warhorses.
Men-at-arms might be freelancers, mercenaries who sell their arms to the highest bidder, but most belong to the retinues of noble families and, together, form elite cadres to defend their patrons’ interests. Men-at-arms employ brutal tactics: they crash into their enemies ranks and then hack them apart, using every advantage their superior height and power afford them.
