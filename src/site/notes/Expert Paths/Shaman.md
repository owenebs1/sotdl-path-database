Shamans stand on the border between the living and the the dead. Able to pierce reality’s veil and behold the disembodied spirits trapped between, shamans use magic to bargain with those spirits and gain their assistance.
As part of their training, shamans call forth and bind a spirit from the Underworld as a guide and aid. This spirit might be that of an ancestor, an animal, or something else. Normally, such a spirit follows the shaman, unseen and unnoticed, but when the shaman wills it, the spirit manifests and lends its capabilities to its master.
