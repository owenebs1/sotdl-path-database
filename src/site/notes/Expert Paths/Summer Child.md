The Queen of Summer urges her mortal servants to create and foster beauty in the world, to inspire artists and celebrate their achievements, and to bring out the best in everyone they encounter. Despite their tolerance and acceptance, the cult holds initiates to exacting standards, expecting them to be passionate, creative, and bright people, free from the negative emotions that weigh down so many others. Any display that would call into question their commitment to the goddess’s teachings sees these initiates eased out of the inner circle to become congregants once more.
The inner circle of priests belongs to the Summer Children, devotees who have had encounters with the goddess or seen first-hand her workings in the world. Not only do they enjoy high standing in the cult, but they can also call directly upon the Queen of Summer to aid them, becoming mirrors of her astonishing beauty and goodness.
