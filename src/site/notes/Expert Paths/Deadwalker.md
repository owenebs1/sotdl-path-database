Death might not be the end of you, even if it does mean the oblivion of your individual self, the utter annihilation of who you were. The prospect of losing everything one has achieved leads many to take incredible steps to preserving themselves against the doom that awaits all mortals and none were better at denying Father Death his due than were the Men of Gog.
Before going into battle, some would undergo a dreadful ritual that would guarantee their return as undead if they fell in battle. Called deadwalkers, they were able to pull their torn and broken bodies back up to continue fighting their enemies.
