Although many users of magic choose to focus their training in a particular way, some simply want to improve their ability to cast the spells they have already learned and pick up a few new ones along the way. Spellslingers figure out ways to tap into greater reservoirs of magical energy and use that energy to amplify their spells. As their mastery over these techniques grows, their spells can pierce their enemies’ defenses and, eventually, they can sling spells with shocking speed.
Most spellslingers come from the ranks of magicians, since followers of that path already have a wide range of spells at their disposal. Magic-using rogues might also embark on this path to build on what they have learned. Some priests, too, especially those in service to gods and religions that encompass war in their portfolio, might take up this path.
