One merely has to look with open eyes to see the signs, the omens hinting at what’s to come, the dangers ahead. Auspexes have trained their senses to see these warnings and interpret their meanings in an instant. The information they gain from their powers of observation enables them to shift their tactics and adjust their actions to produce the most advantageous outcome.
The gift of prophecy lies at the heart of an auspex’s capabilities. Many have always had the talent, seeing strange things in their environment without understanding the meaning of them. In others, the ability lay dormant until some stressful event shattered the mental lock that contained it. In any event, auspexes see the signs around them, odd warnings that others overlook or simply cannot perceive. Such a warning could be a pattern in the arrangement of rocks, a whisper in the wind, or the ominous and unusual behavior of an ordinary animal.
Auspexes can come from all professions and backgrounds. Warriors and rogues, especially, profit from walking this path, as the techniques of the path create opportunities to thwart their foes’ defenses and to avoid danger. Priests devoted to the Seer sometimes go on to become auspexes, finding the path a natural outgrowth of their religious devotion. Magicians too might choose this path to better arm themselves against the challenges ahead, while also further developing their magical abilities.
