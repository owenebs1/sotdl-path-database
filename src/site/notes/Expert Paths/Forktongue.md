The Devil’s hunger for souls is insatiable and thus he rewards those servants who excel at providing them, offering them greater power and lives relatively free from the deleterious effects felt by the darkening of their souls.
Drawn from the ranks of the most diabolical of the Adversary’s servants, the forktongues move through the world, luring mortals onto the path of damnation. Shielded by their master’s favor, they become subtle enemies of the virtuous, hiding their wicked intent behind kindly and helpful masks, while slowly chipping away at their victim’s resolve until they eventually succumb to temptation and embrace the darkness of Hell.
