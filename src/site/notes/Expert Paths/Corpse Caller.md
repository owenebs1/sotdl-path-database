Always found in the company of their vile creations, corpse callers study Necromancy to master the art of making undead to serve as their slaves. Such is their skill, they can rouse a corpse without having to rely on their magic; they simply call out the mystic words and the body responds. Most corpse callers use their servants for protection, but some depend on them to lead the other undead they create in battle.
The corpse callers’ methods originate in the Kingdom of Skulls, where the Dark Lady has made Father Death wholly impotent when it comes to harvesting the dead. The greater freedom users of dark magic enjoy has let them outstrip rivals in distant lands, and they count themselves as some of the most powerful workers of Necromancy that the world has known. Their slaves fight with greater ferocity and can endure more punishment, which gives them a decided edge when hunting down their enemies.
