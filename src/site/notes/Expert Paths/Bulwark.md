To better defend against the orcs marching against the Holy Kingdom, a new class of warriors has emerged.
Called bulwarks, the Cult of the New God relies on these soldiers to bear the brunt of the orc assault and prevent their enemies from gaining territory. To this end, the bulwarks receive advanced training in armor-use and learn how to maximize armor’s protective qualities and modify them to give them a decisive edge on the battlefield.
Although the path reflects the specialized training given by elite warriors of the Holy Kingdom, the methods might have ties to just about any civilization capable of producing heavy armor, such as the dwarfs of the Shield Mountains and the doughty defenders of the March Lands. The armor modifications suggest the wearer has some skill at crafting armor, so blacksmiths and armorers might also follow this path.

| 1   | You’ve been training with armor for so long it has become a second skin.                                                                    |
| 2   | You failed to protect a ward and swore an oath never to fail another again. Now you use your armor so you can protect others.               |
| 3   | You have been created, craft, or grafted for the purpose of waging war. You are more comfortable in armor than you are without it.          |
| 4   | You served under a knight… as a punching bag. Avoiding injury gave you all the encouragement you needed to master the use of armor quickly. |
| 5   | You spent time as a squire to a dwarf dreadnaught.                                                                                          |
| 6   | Armor anchors you to the ground. The thought of all that sky above you fills you with dread.                                                |
