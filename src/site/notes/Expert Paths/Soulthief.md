Somehow, Father Death’s domain remains open to you.
When your body slumbers, your soul wriggles free from the flesh and begins the long descent into the Underworld, where you encounter the countless shades awaiting their chance at rebirth while having to grapple with the dread incurred by the immortal-inflicted loss of their identities.
From time to time, you have managed to lead these souls out from this realm and bring them back to the mortal world, if only for a time. But for as long as they linger, they lend you whatever aid they can.
You must be mortal and have a soul in order to choose this expert path.

| 1   | You died and your soul began to sink into the<br>Underworld, but you somehow held on and returned to your body, bringing yourself back to life. Now, though, you have a connection to Father Death and can move in and out of his realm.                             |
| 2   | You were afflicted with disturbing visions of the Underworld for as long as you can remember.<br>When a dream ended and you found another being inside you, you realized the dreams were true and that you could truly travel into and out of the lands of the dead. |
| 3   | You spent years working to separate your soul from your body by studying ancient texts of Magog, the mad ravings of mystics, and the dark treatises by demonologists. You partly succeeded, but can only wander when your body sleeps.                               |

If you are unconscious from being incapacitated, you must roll an additional die when you make your Fate Roll and use the lowest number. If you are unconscious for any other reason, you must roll a d6 at the end of each round you remain unconscious. If you roll a 1, you become disabled and make Fate Rolls as if you were incapacitated. When you are no longer unconscious, you retrieve another soul. You can use this talent three times and you regain expended uses when you complete a rest.
