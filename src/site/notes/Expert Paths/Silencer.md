The degree to which the Dark Lady and her followers depend on dark magic has led to innovations in its use, from introducing new and terrible spells into the world to new fighting techniques that incorporate that foul magic. Anticipating the coming struggle, the
Dark Lady recruited a number of killers and taught them Death spells to make them more effective killers.
She called them silencers and has since sent them out into the Empire to get close to powerful people and eliminate them as a gift to the returning Witch-King.
Silencers can come from any background and might be magicians with a penchant for the dark arts, cultists devoted to the Dark Lady, cunning warriors, or diabolical rogues. Whatever their background, they weave their lethal spells in with weapon strikes.
This way, they can attack with shocking force to bring down the toughest foe.
