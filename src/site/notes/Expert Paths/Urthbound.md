You always come back from the dead. Some folks might think this a good thing, a wondrous miracle, but you have learned otherwise. Dying is hard and it’s something you’d prefer to never do again if you can help it. It takes a hard toll, dying does, and you carry the scars on your body and mind from each brush with Father Death. You’re not quite sure what you did to earn this curse, but surely it can’t last forever?
You must have a soul, be alive, and be mortal to choose this expert path.

- Increase your Power by 1. Then, either discover a tradition or learn a spell.

**Undying** If you die and your head is still attached to your body, you return to life after 1d6 rounds. When you return to life, you heal 1 damage, but you take a –5 penalty to Health, gain 1d3 Insanity, and become fatigued for as long as you have the penalty to Health.
Each time you complete a rest, roll a d6 and reduce the penalty to your Health by the amount rolled (minimum 0 penalty). If you die and already have a penalty to your Health, the penalty worsens by 5 when you return to life.
If the penalty would cause your Health to drop to 0, you lose this talent and you die.
Returning to life from this talent does not restore lost body parts, cure diseases, neutralize poisons or venoms in your system. You lose this talent if you are beheaded.
