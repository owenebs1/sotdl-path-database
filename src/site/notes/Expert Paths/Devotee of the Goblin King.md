The Goblin King dwells at the center of a great, deadly maze filled with twists and turns, traps, and terrible monsters. Fearing reprisals from his enemy, the Faerie Queen, he hides in the heart of this place, passing his days in a palace of maddening design. Though secluded from the world, he remains interested in the goings-on beyond his realm and relies on his devotees to keep him informed.
While not truly priests, devotees of the Goblin King occupy a similar place among the goblin peoples, serving as advisors to tribal leaders and reminding goblins that the master is never far from them, no matter how desperate their circumstances. Devotees also act as spies for their master. Each night, they clutch a shard of mirror and whisper all the secrets they learned that day, believing the mirror will spirit their words through the maze and into their master’s ear.
Devotees show fealty to their master by wearing medallions carved from wood that look like grinning goblin faces. Symbols might have subtle differences, but they are recognizable to anyone familiar with the Goblin King. Many devotees dress in the manner of other goblins, wearing whatever they can find, while some don fantastical and absurd costumes to parade the favor they have earned over their fellows.
It is possible, though unlikely, for members of other ancestries to pledge service to the Goblin King.
