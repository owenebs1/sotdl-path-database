Not all warriors fight with weapons. Some, because of their great size, find their bare hands equal to the task of smashing enemies. These juggernauts all have great size and strength and can use these assets to best advantage. They wade in among their foes and use their hands to twist necks and rip off arms. Jotun, ogres, and other large peoples are the most likely to become juggernauts.
