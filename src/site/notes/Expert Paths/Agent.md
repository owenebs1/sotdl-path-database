Whether by eavesdropping on a conversation or by infiltrating a secure location to make off with crucial information, agents specialize in gathering intelligence without anyone becoming the wiser.
Many agents work as freelancers, hiring out their talents to whoever can afford their high price.
Secular organizations, such as the Vault and the Tower Arcane, employ agents to monitor their enemies and rivals, or to track those who have crossed them, while religious institutions sometimes use agents to sniff out heretics and other enemies of the faith. Governments are the most likely to employ agents full-time, because the information these assets can gather might help avert defeats and bring enemy nations to their knees.

| 1   | You worked as an informant for a crime lord, a priest, or a noble, passing on information as it came to you.                                     |
| 2   | You developed your talents while trying to gather proof of wrongdoing by a government official, a noble, or someone else in a position of power. |
| 3   | A criminal past laid the foundation for the talents you use now.                                                                                 |

# Level 6

**Size Up** You can use an action to size up one creature you can see within short range. Make a Perception attack roll against the target’s Intellect. On a success, for 1 minute you impose 1 bane on the target’s attack rolls against you, and you make challenge rolls to resist the target’s attacks with 1 boon.
**Contacts** You have three contacts. Work with your GM to determine the identities of these contacts and the kinds of information they can provide to you. You can leave one or more of them undefined so you can develop new contacts when you visit an urban environment. You gain an additional contact when your group level reaches 8 and another at level 10.
When you interact with a contact, you can choose to use up the contact instead of just gaining information. When you use up a contact, you can gain material aid (up to 1d6 gc worth) or have the contact perform a task for you, though the task cannot be anything that would imperil the contact’s life, loved ones, or property. The contact does what you request to the best of his or her ability. Once you use up a contact, that contact cannot be replaced until your group level increases, at which time you can add contacts to replace any you used up.
