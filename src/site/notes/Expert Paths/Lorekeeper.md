Lorekeepers gather and preserve esoteric knowledge.
They scour the world for lost lore, travel widely to witness the greatest events to capture them in the records they meticulously keep, and keep safe the secrets of old lest they fall into the wrong hands.
Considered the most learned of people in the Empire’s lands, lorekeepers can be found in the courts of kings and queens, watching over great libraries and accompanying some of the greatest heroes.
Lorekeepers know much already, but their insatiable appetite for knowledge drives them ever onward.
They like nothing more than to dig into old records or leaf through ancient texts to discover facts about lost peoples and lands. For them, no secret is too dangerous, no subject forbidden. Knowledge is all that matters, and lorekeepers stop at nothing to discover all they can in the time they have been given.
