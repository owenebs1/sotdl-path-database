Exemplars commit themselves to the highest ideals and see themselves as champions of virtue and order.
Like paladins, they travel the world, bringing light into the darkness and crushing those who would disrupt or destroy the world as it is. Unlike paladins, though, exemplars rely on magic to deal with their enemies. From bolts of scintillating light to ringing pronouncements that quash discord and upheaval, they are the very paragons of law in the cosmos.
Nearly all exemplars come from the ranks of religions that embody the virtues of justice, discipline, and order. One can find exemplars dedicated to the New God, but also those who fight in the name of the Devil, whose hated light reaches across all of Hell and torments the damned souls condemned to that awful place. Some exemplars serve the Summer Queen, while others come from Nessus and the members of the diminished Order of Light that still practice their nearly forgotten faith.

| 1   | An angel visited you in your dreams and chose you to serve your god.                                                                                               |

**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Celestial or Order tradition or learn one Celestial or Order spell.
**Inner Radiance** When you cast a Celestial spell or an Order spell, you can use a triggered action to release your inner radiance, causing light to shine from your body for 1 minute out to a number of yards equal to 1 + your Power score.

# Level 6

**Imperious Light** While you are emitting light from the effect of your Inner Radiance talent, you can use an action to force one creature within the area of light to make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes immobilized for 1 minute or until it is no longer in the radius of your light. When the creature is immobilized in this way, it is also blinded. At the end of each round, an affected creature can repeat the roll and removes the immobilized affliction from itself on a success. Once you use this talent, you must wait at least 1 minute before you can use it again.
