The various faiths found across Rûl deploy a wide range of servants to advance their agendas. From the itinerant clerics who roam the lands as living examples of their faith, to the paladins who take up arms against the enemies of their religions, or the holy wardens who protect the sites sacred to the Old Faith, people from many different backgrounds might be called to serve the gods and wield their divine power. Emissaries represent another branch of divine service, being comprised of agents and specialists who undertake missions of supreme importance for their religious institutions. Emissaries might venture into conquered lands to reclaim holy relics, lead uprisings of righteous people against depraved and diabolical rulers, or hunt down heretics and demon-worshipers on behalf of the Inquisition. In whatever capacity they serve, emissaries can call upon divine powers to aid them in difficult situations, manifesting their steadfast devotion and strength of faith through astonishing deeds.
