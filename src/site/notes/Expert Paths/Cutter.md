Some warriors prefer to get up close to their opponents, to slip under their reach and carve them up with blades. Cutters study a fighting style that favors knives, daggers, hatchets, and the like. Swift and accurate, they dart and weave through the press, striking with serpent speed to open up their enemies and let the blood flow. Make no mistake: just because cutters prefer light, fast weapons does not mean they sacrifice their durability; they are every bit as tough as other fighters.
Cutters often come from the ranks of warriors, who look to exploit their favored weaponsâ€™ versatility. But they could also have been rogues. These scoundrels devote themselves to mastering arms to get the upper hand against their foes. Other characters might come to this path seeking more options for self-defense in battle.
