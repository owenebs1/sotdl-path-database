Vampirism offers great power at a terrible price. Vampires are faster and stronger than ordinary humans, but they suffer from an overpowering thirst for blood. Unable to walk in sunlight, they become creatures of the night, skulking in the shadows to ambush their prey and evade the inquisitors who would consign them to the purifying flames.
Their dependency on fresh blood creates enemies wherever vampires go. Communities soon grow wise to the predator in their midst; the hunter becomes the prey as the people gather into bloodthirsty mobs intent on destroying it. Thus vampires need cunning and control over their dark impulses to survive the many dangers arrayed against them. Princes of darkness find ways to keep their blood thirst in check and to improve their talents. They suffer from all the same weaknesses as their fellows but develop techniques to aid in hunting, withstand enemiesâ€™ attacks, and elude discovery and capture.
**To choose this expert path, you must be a vampire.**
