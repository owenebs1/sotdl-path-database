The uncomfortable truth few mortals dare face is that the gods play no part in existence. If they are real at all, they are distant figures, unmoved by the suffering in the world or the pleas of their faithful. People from all walks and backgrounds have set aside faith, striving to understand the world in which they live and their place in it. Lack of belief does not make one bad or any more susceptible to corruption than the faithful. But just as followers of the New God or the Old Faith can twist their beliefs toward evil ends, so too can unbelievers become lost in the darkness staining their souls.
Apostates not only reject the gods—they actively work against them. They prey on the devout, burning their temples and shattering their idols. They are forces of entropy, agents of destruction, reveling in the lives they break and the devotion they dismantle. They can be fallen priests or godless warriors, seekers of horrible truths, or callous opportunists who exploit the faiths of others.

| 1   | You were a priest or studied to become one, but a crisis of faith steered you from the righteous path to forge a new and darker one. You abandoned your beliefs to find succor in the here and now. |
| 2   | You believe the gods are nothing more than manifestations of mortal belief on magic, and you have come to resent their power.                                                                       |
| 3   | You hold beliefs that other members of your religion deem heretical. Although your enemies hound you, certainty drives you on, and you spread the uncomfortable message to all who will listen.     |
| 4   | You burgled the offices of a high priest and discovered something among the valuables you stole that shook your beliefs to their foundations.                                                       |
| 5   | You reject the gods and name yourself their enemy. Your blade craves believer’s blood, and nothing will stop you from wetting it.                                                                   |
| 6   | You pledged your soul to the lord of Hell long ago and use the power your master grants to dismantle the religions of lesser gods.                                                                  |
