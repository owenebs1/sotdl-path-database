Psychics belong to a rare class of individuals born with the ability to harness the power of the mind. This ability allows psychics to use magic without the props and mystic phrases required by other magicians. All a psychic needs to do is focus the mind, exerting will and imagination. Although psychics are uncommon, members of any ancestry might become one.
Most psychics are magicians. The training of that path helps discipline the mind and reveal the magic that burgeons inside it. Upon becoming a psychic, most trained magicians, having discovered the power that lay within, abandon magical institutions and formal practices.
Aside from magicians, many psychics begin their careers as rogues. Some, especially those that dabble in magic or rely on subterfuge or threat, are ideally suited to the psychic path, having the wit and will to master its powers.
