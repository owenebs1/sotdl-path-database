The religion of the Dark Gods has little formal structure. The myths and beliefs underpinning it bend to conform to the expectations of their followers. Priests of the faith are as much warriors as they are religious leaders, and they offer the carnage they create as prayers to the mad gods who watch over them. Most priests of the Dark Gods go on to become gothi, religious battle leaders and advisors to the chieftains and thanes. Some priests and other warriors as well, though, the Dark Gods single out for another purpose: to become ruiners, avatars of their destructive impulse.
Like berserkers, ruiners hew their way across battlefields, heedless of the injuries they sustain along the way. As they rush down the path of rage and ruin, these crazed individuals become divorced from their kith and kin, driven by supernatural impulse to create chaos and kill. As a result, ruiners are feared by other members of their faith. They are most common among orc followers of the Dark Gods.
