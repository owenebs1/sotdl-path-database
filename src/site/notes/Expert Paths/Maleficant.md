Although generally considered a benevolent and good religion, witchcraft has a dark side, and those who embrace that aspect manipulate black magic for diabolical ends. Most witches reject the maleficants, witches who follow the left-hand path, seeing them as pariahs and enemies of their faith. These black witches pursue forbidden knowledge and learn spells from dark magic traditions as a means to an end, usually to protect themselves against anyone they deem an enemy, whether an overzealous inquisitor or a tyrannical noble who torments the people living under his or her rule. Others embrace wickedness for the power it offers.

| 1   | Hatred and bitterness led you down a dark path, one that promised you the vengeance you so desperately crave.                                                                                                            |
| 2   | You bargained with a devil for power in exchange for your soul. The talents you gained as a maleficant reflect the rewards of your dread pact.                                                                           |

# Level 6

**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Horrid Poppet** If you carry a control doll (see Shadow, page 123) of a target creature, you can use your Spite talent against that creature regardless of its distance from you. In addition, the benefits of using a control doll apply to spells of any tradition you cast against the target. Finally, when you cast a Curse attack spell against a target from which you have made a control doll, you increase the number of boons granted and banes imposed by 1.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Bind Servant** You can use an action to bind one target creature you can see within short range from which you made a control doll. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. If the target’s Health score is 30 or less, you make the roll with 1 boon. On a success, the target becomes bound to you until you die, the target dies, or you use this talent again.
Until this effect ends, you can use an action to perceive from the target’s space as if you were in that space for as long as you concentrate. While perceiving in this way, you are insensate in regard to your own space.
In addition, you can use an action to give the target 1d3 Insanity in order to heal damage equal to your healing rate.
Finally, you can use an action to cause an image of the target to appear on a reflective surface you can see within short range and remain there for as long as you concentrate. The image reveals the target and the area within short range of it.
