A building collapses. A wagon throws a wheel.
A champion’s armor fails at the most desperate moment. These events could be a turn of bad luck—or they could be the work of a saboteur.
Saboteurs sow chaos and unrest by dismantling and destroying the works of their enemies. By attacking their equipment, they weaken their foes and create confusion when something fails to work as it should and with little explanation. Saboteurs need access to the items they seek to undermine, which means most saboteurs are skilled at stealth, infiltration, and disguise.

# Level 3
**Attributes** Increase two by 1
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Languages and Professions** You speak another language or add a criminal profession.
**Breaker** Your attacks against constructs and objects deal 2d6 extra damage.
**Quick Reflexes** On your turn, you can use a triggered action to hide or retreat.
**Sabotage** You know how to use a tool kit to sabotage objects so that they break under specific conditions.
Choose one object or part of an object you can reach.
You must then concentrate, during which time you use your tools to weaken the target. The amount of time it takes depends on the object’s Size. If the object is smaller than Size 1, you must concentrate for 1 minute.
If the object is Size 1, you must concentrate for 10 minutes. If the object is Size 2 or larger, you must concentrate for 1 hour plus 1 hour per point its Size is greater than 2. When you finish, you sabotage the object.
When you sabotage an object, you can either choose to break the object, in which case the object takes damage equal to its Health, or you can have the object break under a specific condition as you decide. You might choose to have the object break after a period of time, when it’s used, or under some other circumstance with the GM’s approval.
When the condition is met, the object or part of the object takes damage equal to its Health.
Breaking an object in this way could have other results. For example, if you sabotage a bomb (see Demon Lord’s Companion), it might detonate when it’s destroyed. If you sabotage a boat, it might sink, carrying any passengers and cargo with it.
The GM can decide certain objects cannot be affected by this talent or that some uses might take even more time. For example, you can’t use this talent to sabotage an entire sailing ship, though you could sabotage the mast or part of the hull. Similarly, if you try to use this talent to sabotage part of a floor in a passage the GM might rule that you have to spend a significant amount of time digging under it to weaken the floor.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Perception +1, Health +3
**Trap Expertise** You make challenge rolls to find, disarm, and resist the effects of traps with 2 boons.
**Set Trap** You know how to create minor traps using a tool kit and trap components worth 5 ss. Choose a cube of space you can reach, up to 2 yards on each side. You must then concentrate for 10 minutes, during which time you use your tools to assemble the components into one of the following traps. When you finish, the trap is set.
When a creature enters the trapped space, it triggers the trap with the effects described below. The trap remains until triggered or until you use an action to dismantle the trap. If you dismantle the trap, you regain all the trap components you used. A creature can find the trap by searching the spot where you placed it and getting a success on a Perception challenge roll with 1 bane.
A creature can use tools to disarm it by making an Intellect attack roll against your Intellect score.
- Alarm: When triggered, the trap creates a loud noise that lasts for 1 minute. The alarm can be heard from up to 1,000 yards away.
- Harm: When triggered, the trap deals 4d6 damage to the triggering creature. The kind of damage depends on the nature of the trap you created.
- Obstacle: When triggered, the trap makes passage through its space difficult or impossible. You might rig a deadfall or collapse the floor.
- Snare: When triggered, the triggering creature becomes immobilized. A creature can remove the affliction by getting a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane.
# Level 9
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Deadly Sabotage** When an object is destroyed by your Sabotage talent, any creature in direct contact with the object must make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane.
A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failure, or half the damage on a success.
**Rapid Trap** It takes you only 1 minute to use your Set Trap talent.
**Evasive Maneuver** When you get a success on an Agility challenge roll and your Speed is at least 2, you can move up to 2 yards without triggering a free attack.
