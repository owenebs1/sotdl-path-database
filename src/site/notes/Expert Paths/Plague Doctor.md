Plague doctors came about during the Shuddering Pox, when the belief was rampant that disease was caused by miasmas, putrid air. Adorned with masks like birds’ heads filled with herbs and fragrances to protect from foul atmosphere, these people used any kind of medicine they could to heal the sick.
You are one such plague doctor. Experienced with using the latest medical technology, you combine your knowledge of anatomy and medicine to create beneficial or debilitating effects in others. Your theory of disease treatment could be bloodletting with leeches, homeopathic “like cures like” techniques, balancing the four humors, combating miasmas, or even germ theory.

# Level 3
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase both by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Languages and Professions** You either add a language to the list of languages you can speak or you learn to read a language you already know how to speak. Also, you gain one of the following academic areas of scholarship: medicine, nature, or science.
**Brew Concoction** When you finish a rest, you create a number of concoctions equal to 1d6 + half your level. The concoctions retain potency until used or you use this talent again.
Any creature with medicine as an area of scholarship that holds a concoction can use an action, or a triggered action on its turn, to apply the concoction to a target creature it can reach. If the target is not willing, the creature must make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Agility and administers the concoction on a success. The creature administering the concoction chooses one of the following effects:
- The target heals damage equal to its healing rate.
- The target takes 2d6 damage.
- The target becomes fatigued, frightened, impaired, poisoned, or slowed for 1 minute.
- The target removes one of the following afflictions from itself: fatigued, frightened, impaired, poisoned, or slowed.

**Treat Disease** You can spend 8 hours treating a number of target diseased creatures equal to your level + your Intellect modifier. At the end of this time, each treated target makes challenge rolls to fight off the effects of the disease with 3 boons. The benefit lasts for 24 hours.
# Level 6
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Languages and Professions** Add a language to the list of languages you can speak or gain a profession of your choice.
**Plague Mask** You have a special mask that has glass lenses and a bird-like beak filled with herbs and aromatics designed to filter the air and protect you from your patients. While wearing the mask, you are immune to the diseased and poisoned afflictions. If you are already diseased, this mask instead grants three boons to your challenge rolls made to resist the disease.
