Illusion magic works by tricking the senses. Its spells fool other creatures and confound their efforts to discern reality from fantasy, but there are some students of the tradition who seek to create illusions with more substantive effects. While some focus on their art, others search for solutions within other traditions, such as Shadow.
Shadowmancers learn to weave threads of shadowstuff into their illusions and to enhance the darkness they wield with false images and sounds. The combination of these traditions allows shadowmancers to alter reality around themselves to terrorize their enemies. Whether they spawn hideous monsters of living darkness or loose darkness filled with terrifying noises, they command magic that plunges others into waking nightmares.
