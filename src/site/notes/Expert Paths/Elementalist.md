Elementalists harness the fundamental forces underpinning reality by manifesting them within their bodies. Attuning to air, earth, fire, or water lets elementalists empower spells and enhance abilities with the elemental energy. While attuned, elementalists display minor changes to their appearances—air manifests as a everpresent breeze, earth manifests as the flesh becoming like stone, fire as blazing eyes, and water as dripping moisture.
