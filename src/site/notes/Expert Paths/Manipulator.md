Faeries wield magic as old as the world and have generally used their knowledge to deceive and manipulate others. Their methods all prove of great use when they would avoid detection and the angry reprisals that result from their malicious treachery.
These techniques might be common to the faeries, but they can be learned by other creatures, and many who have discovered the Enchantment or Fey tradition find that there is much to gain by emulating the immortals.
Manipulators exert incredible influence over the minds of their victims. A manipulator can reach into someone’s thoughts and use magic to twist that person’s emotions to suit whatever need the manipulator might have. Manipulators use their magic to get what they want from the world, to force others to work on their behalf, and to profit from those victims’ misfortune. As a result, manipulators tend to make enemies wherever they go.
