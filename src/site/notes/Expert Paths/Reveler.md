The Laughing God attracts people who have rid themselves of any sense of propriety, restraint, and responsibility. For these devotees, life is to be enjoyed to the fullest and anything that interferes with the pursuit of pleasure is to be shunned. Although most deride Revel’s followers as unabashed hedonists, people of low character and no control, in truth Revel draws devotees from nearly all walks in life, from courtesans and drunkards to nobles, disgraced priests of other faiths, and artists of all kinds. Revel offers escape from the drudgery of life and the pain of existence, and to know Revel is to embrace true freedom.
Priests of Revel can pursue a wide range of paths, becoming crazed berserkers or holy oracles who welcome their mad patron into their bodies.
Some, though, continue in the cult’s service as revelers, individuals who have no desire beyond continuing to sample the many pleasures their master offers.
Revelers take charge of local cults, hosting celebrations and parties so they can infect their congregations with the same feverish desires they experience themselves. Few emerge from such gatherings with their sanity intact.
