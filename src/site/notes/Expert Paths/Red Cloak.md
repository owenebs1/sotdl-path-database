The House of Healing has brought hope to places suffering under the weight of sickness and violence.
The Red Cloaks, healers of extraordinary ability, travel the land, bringing comfort to those in need and with no expectation of remuneration. Due to their efforts, the Shuddering Pox—the plague that precipitated the founding of the House—has largely disappeared from the land. Now the Red Cloaks continue their good works in other ways.
You studied at one of the Houses of Healing to learn the advanced healing arts. Before you could learn these techniques, you swore an oath to do no harm, to injure no creature, even at risk of your own life. In return for your vow, you were taught how to combat the various ills blighting the world until you became a healer with almost supernatural abilities.
As a Red Cloak, you are never seen without the crimson cape that identifies members of the House of Healing. Also, you have a tattoo of an open red hand somewhere on your face. Your membership in the organization gives you great mobility and freedom, since almost all people recognize and generally support your efforts to do good in the world.
