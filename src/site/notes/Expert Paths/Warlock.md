Warlocks, called oath-breakers by some, are counted by wizards as the most despicable of the users of magic, for they come by their power by underhanded means. Rather than study ancient texts or pledge their lives to a god or gods, warlocks steal their magic from anyone and everyone they can, be they dread agents of the underworld or from the minds of rival casters. With the talents and techniques to do so, warlocks take whatever power they want from whomever they wish.
Most warlocks come from magical backgrounds, having at least dabbled in magic. They include has-been or failed magicians, defrocked priests, or even rogues who managed to learn a few tricks. Whatever their origins, they pursue magical knowledge in fell places, making deals with devils, faeries, or any other being who might bestow on them the knowledge they crave. Not content with the gains they make through their bargains, warlocks eventually learn techniques to take spells from others directly. All they need to do is witness the spell being cast and they can pluck it from the air, causing the original spell to fizzle out and enabling them with the ability to cast it themselves.

| 1   | You made a pact with a devil, offering the dark faerie your soul in exchange for the secrets of magical power. You have reached the limits of your bargain and now steal spells from others.                      |
| 2   | You discovered a strange little statuette and became obsessed with it, keeping it near you when you slept. The statuette whispered to you in your dreams, teaching you the art of stealing spells.                |
| 3   | You learned how to filch spells from the minds of others while enrolled at an institution of magical study, and you were kicked out when it was discovered you were doing so with impunity.                       |
| 4   | You made an enemy of a powerful spellcaster. You learned the warlock’s techniques to protect yourself against what you see as their inevitable revenge.                                                           |
| 5   | You felt the sting of one spell too many and set out to find a way to protect yourself from magic. Stealing spells and sending them back at their casters will teach your enemies to use their magic more wisely. |
| 6   | You crave magical power, but lack the training to pursue it. You’ve learned enough to steal spells from others and gain their magic for yourself.                                                                 |
