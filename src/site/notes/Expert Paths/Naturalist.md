Anyone trained in the ways of the Old Faith knows of the magic that flows through the natural world. Most who come to study Nature magic worship the old gods or have some other connection to the physical world.
Yet there are some academic students of magic who would tap into this vital source of energy and use it to augment their capabilities. Such individuals are called naturalists.
Many naturalists, sometimes referred to as green wizards or forest mages, consider Nature magic as yet another source of magic to be studied and mastered, and they bring to bear their considerable knowledge to apprehending its power. Yet, for every naturalist who wields the magic of the trees and grasses for personal ends, there is one who began his or her understanding of magic by discovering the Nature tradition and who then went on to studying other disciplines. In both cases, naturalists can use their environment to their advantage, calling up the very land itself to come to their defense while they hurl deadly spells at their foes.
