The gothi are the exalted servants of the Dark Gods. Fierce, violent, and savage, they lead the fight against weaker peoples, plundering distant lands for riches, slaves, and whatever else they can carry. Though all followers of the Dark Gods believe in the wyrd, the gothi are unique for having seen their doom and knowing the day of their deaths. Rather than shrink in fear from the end, they move toward it with confidence, eager to wet their blades with the blood of their enemies. Of course, the gods sometimes lie, but when death comes before the expected time, the gothi greet their doom with laughter.
Gothi enjoy high standing among their people, valued for their mystic connections to the gods of Blood and Iron, and feared for their almost insane bravado.
