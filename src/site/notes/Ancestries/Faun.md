| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | Little trace of your human heritage appears in your features, and your face is strange and angular. Unusual whorls mark your leathery hide. Others might become uncomfortable when they see you.  |
| 4     | You are brutish, more like a wild animal than a person. Your eyes are those of a goat, and your posture is hunched, your gait lurching.                                                           |
| 5–6   | Nothing about you is attractive. Human qualities are evident here and there, but your abundant animal traits overshadow them.                                                                     |
| 7–8   | Your animal traits are subdued—your horns are mere nubs, and the fur covering your legs is thin.                                                                                                  |
| 9–12  | You look like most other fauns, with small horns on your brow and legs covered in fur down to your cloven feet.                                                                                   |
| 13–14 | You have an appealing appearance, such as a well-formed body, bright eyes, or warm smile. Your appearance can put others more at ease.                                                            |
| 15–16 | You are quite attractive.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17    | You are so striking to behold that others often want to be around you.                                                                                                                            |
| 18    | You inherited the very best qualities from your mortal and immortal parents. You have a perfect physique, exotic features, and an air about you that captures the attention of everyone you meet. |
