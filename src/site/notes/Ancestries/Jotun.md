| 1   | Your clan cast you out for cowardice. You might strive either to regain your honor or to embrace your nature.                                 |
| 2   | While ranging across the Blasted Lands, you encountered a band of cold ones and nearly died in the fighting.                                  |
| 3   | You were beaten badly after you challenged another jotun to a duel. You bear the scars still.                                                 |
| 4   | Trows, cousins to the dwarfs, took you prisoner. They treated you well, but you had to murder several of them to escape.                      |
| 5   | You grew up hearing tales about the evil Empire in the north. You hope to win glory and honor by slaughtering the humans living there.        |
| 6   | You became lost in the frozen wastes and experienced unsettling visions. Start the game with 1d3 Insanity.                                    |
| 7   | You were widely feared and respected by your clan. You earned your reputation for being ferocious in a fight and leaving your victims maimed. |

| 10  | You earned a living working in your profession.                                                                                               |
| 11  | You fell in love with a human who eventually rejected you. You still have an eye for humans.                                                  |
| 12  | A raven of Grimnir, the one-eyed god of your people, came to you and revealed your wyrd. You left your homeland to seek it.                   |
| 13  | You left your homeland to see the world.                                                                                                      |
| 14  | A storm destroyed your ship, and you alone washed ashore in human lands.                                                                      |
| 15  | You inherited a sword or a battleaxe. The weapon is fine and covered in runes, though it does not appear to be magical in nature.             |
| 16  | You befriended a skald and learned many of the old songs and stories.                                                                         |
| 17  | A family member dabbled in dark magic and left a stain on your clan’s reputation.                                                             |
| 18  | You performed a great deed, and your people consider you a hero.                                                                              |
