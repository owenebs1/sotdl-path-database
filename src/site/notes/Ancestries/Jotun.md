Though it has been centuries since the jotun ravaged the Empire’s western coasts, imperials still speak of the giant-blooded raiders in hushed whispers. They have good cause to fret, for since their crushing defeat at the hands of the Empire’s elite soldiers and cunning wizards, the jotun have bided their time, nursing their hatred while waiting for the Great Wolf to devour the sun, which will signal the time to set sail once more and drown the Empire in blood.
**Blood of Giants:** Jotun boast that they have the blood of giants flowing through their veins, and their great size and menacing demeanor suggest there might be something to their proclamations. Standing 8 to 10 feet tall and weighing 400 to 800 pounds, they tower over most people. Compared to humans, even the scrawniest jotun benefit from big frames covered with slabs of muscle. They all have thick, brutish features. Most find the sun painful due to widespread albinism, which accounts for their crimson eyes and chalky white skin.
**Mankind’s Greatest Foes:** The jotun plagued civilization for centuries. Every year when the seas thawed and the ice receded, the jotun would board longships and raise black sails to venture north and visit horror on the weak, the soft, and the fearful. Raiding was necessary to the jotun’s survival because it provided the grains, textiles, gold, and slaves to sustain their society. Of course, raiding also meant battle, and every jotun saw these expeditions as a way to become blooded and earn a place among the jarl’s household.
Success in their incessant raiding along the Empire’s southern coasts emboldened the jotun to venture into the nation’s interior by sailing up rivers. Such a strike into the heartland, along with the death of the emperor’s heir, roused the full anger of the Alabaster Throne. The emperor sent legions south to destroy them. Although they were ferocious and battle-hardened, the jotun could not stand against the Empire’s battle wizards or ironclad soldiers.
For the Empire, breaking the jotun was not enough. The imperial legions invaded their realm, crucified their chieftains, and enslaved the people. From these captives, they made the orcs that would serve the emperors for centuries.
The jotun have since recovered from their defeat and have endured the many centuries since while waiting for their time of vengeance. Although most jotun remain in the frozen wastes, a few seek their fortunes in the north as mercenaries, guards, and adventurers.
**Strength and Courage:** A culture focused on battle creates people who pride themselves on being strong and brave. To join the ranks of the warriors, one must pass the tests of blood and iron—a brutal series of contests involving brawls, hurling weapons, fighting beasts, and more that unfolds over several days. The weak succumb, their bodies tossed into the dark waters to feed the kraken that will one day rise from the depths to crush the world. The survivors become champions, battle-ready and proven.
Jotun enjoy crude humor, drinking, and boasting. They tell riddles or enjoy the skalds’ tales of their great heroes, the foibles of the gods, and the mishaps that befell the wretched trows. Superstitious, the jotun see omens everywhere and believe the gods walk among them. Cowardice is the greatest crime a jotun could commit. Many jotun believe that fl eeing from an enemy brings shame not only to themselves, but to their entire clan.
**The Wyrd:** The jotun believe that Grimnir has laid eyes on the beginnings of all things and has seen the end as well. His knowledge means that all has been decided, and each person’s fate has already been written. The concept of the wyrd (which can be taken as destiny, doom, or fate) haunts the jotun, shaping their view of the world and defining the place they have in it. There can be no escaping the doom foreseen by Grimnir, so there is no sense fighting it. Accept what is, and chase glory until the end.

| 2   | While ranging across the Blasted Lands, you encountered a band of cold ones and nearly died in the fighting.                                  |

| 4   | Trows, cousins to the dwarfs, took you prisoner. They treated you well, but you had to murder several of them to escape.                      |
| 5   | You grew up hearing tales about the evil Empire in the north. You hope to win glory and honor by slaughtering the humans living there.        |
| 6   | You became lost in the frozen wastes and experienced unsettling visions. Start the game with 1d3 Insanity.                                    |

| 13  | You left your homeland to see the world.                                                                                                      |
| 14  | A storm destroyed your ship, and you alone washed ashore in human lands.                                                                      |

| 16  | You befriended a skald and learned many of the old songs and stories.                                                                         |

| 18  | You performed a great deed, and your people consider you a hero.                                                                              |
