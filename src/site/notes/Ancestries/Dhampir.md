| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | A witch hunter discovered the truth about you, hunted you down, and captured you. Rather than turn you over to the inquisitors or put you to the torch, the man became enamored with you and his amorous attentions made you suffer. You eventually escaped after killing him and have been on the run ever since. |
| 2   | You only recently discovered the truth of who you really are. Now that you have a taste for blood, the need for more occupies your every waking thought.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3   | You traveled into the Desolation to seek a way to purge your body of its foul taint. You returned shaken by what you experienced there.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | You spent many years in a Confederacy city, surrounding yourself with lovers and friends, sampling the best that life offers. When your nature was exposed, you lost everything and had to flee for your life.                                                                                                     |
| 5   | You spent many years learning all you could about vampires so you could kill them and remove their stain from the world.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | In the heat of passion, you lost control and killed your one true love. You carry the guilt and shame of the act with you, cursing yourself for a monster.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7   | Witch hunters found and killed everyone in your family. You escaped the violence after your mother hid you in a wall. You have vowed to kill each hunter involved.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | You traveled widely, moving from place to place, to stay ahead of the people who hunt you. You did something in your past that made you many enemies, and now they scour the lands for you. If they catch you they will kill you.                                                                                  |
| 9   | You joined bandits in raiding caravans and killed many people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10  | You have done your very best to hide among humans in a small village, keeping your nature a secret. Someone found out about you, though, and the local priest tried to stake your heart. You fled, mourning the life you lost.                                                                                     |
| 11  | You were abandoned as a child and somehow managed to survive until you reached your present age. Perhaps faeries watched over you or wolves raised you. The civilized world is strange to you and makes you uncomfortable when in it.                                                                              |
| 12  | Fearing your unnatural existence, you locked yourself away, passing the years in study and meditation.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13  | You embraced your vampiric heritage. You lived in a tomb, slept in a coffin, and fed on the living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14  | Pretending to be human, you joined the Cult of the New God and became one of its most popular acolytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15  | You tried to bury your heritage and live a normal life. You took a spouse and had children, but your last child was born a monster. You fled the community with your family, but your spouse betrayed you and you lost them all.                                                                                   |
| 16  | To quell your cravings for blood, you indulged in every vice you could find, wrecking your body and your mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17  | You spent time living among ghouls as their regent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18  | You killed someone for money. You found you were good at that work and have set out to improve your skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19  | You spent a few years as part of a vampire’s entourage. You grew to hate your master and left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20  | You spent months in an asylum after you went to seek help for your affliction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 3     | You embraced your dark heritage and have become a monster. You feed your excesses whenever you can and you take pleasure in making others suffer. There is no act too despicable for you to at least consider doing. You are a true villain. |
| 4–5   | You are the only person who matters. Everyone else exists to serve your needs. You take what you want, do what you want, and damn the consequences.                                                                                          |
| 6–8   | You have little concern for other people. You might experience the occasional pang of conscience, but you usually ignore it.                                                                                                                 |
| 9–12  | You see to your own wants and needs before you concern yourself with others.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 13–15 | You are generous and friendly, and look after others as much as you do yourself.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 16–17 | You have the very best intentions and see your existence as a terrible curse. You try to fight against the darkness in your heart by doing good in the world.                                                                                |
| 18    | A moral paragon, you have an unimpeachable character. You always do the right thing when possible, and you are willing to help others even if it means harming yourself.                                                                     |
