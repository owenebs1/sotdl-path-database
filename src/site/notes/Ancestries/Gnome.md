From earth and stone, the genies fashioned the gnomes, infusing them with life to serve as builders and shapers, to become the makers of things. Gnomes raised the mountains and carved the paths the rivers would take. They planted the forests and pushed the earth to form hills and valleys. They took the raw, untamed world the genies spun out from chaos and gave it shape, purpose, and beauty.
The gnomes were among the first to flee after the genies’ dominion unraveled. A furtive people, frightened of their makers, they dug into the earth, opening spaces where they could survive the madness of the genies and the rise of less worthy inheritors, such as the intruding faeries who picked up the fallen mantle and rule in genies’ stead.
Generations spent in the depths of the earth instilled in the gnomes a deep and abiding fear of the surface and the painful light of the hated sun. The gnomes contented themselves with exploring their subterranean world, unearthing glittering treasures from the raw stone, following veins of gold and silver, and discovering secrets and places buried since the dawn of the world. Their isolation and refusal to interact with the peoples in the world above made them a mythical people, the subject of tales told by miners who became lost in the dark or heard strange sounds coming from beyond the light of their lanterns.
If the gnomes had a choice, they would have remained in the depths, but the Destroyer’s approach has forced them out. Earthquakes have shaken the mountains to their foundations, letting loose the world’s blood as fiery lava to flood their homes. Strange things have torn free from their subterranean prisons and run through the tunnels, their screeches as sharp as their claws. With nowhere to turn, the gnomes have emerged from the depths once more, finding the world they left much changed from how they left it.
**Children of Earth and Stone:** Generations spent underground have transformed gnomes into their present state. No taller than 3 feet, they have short, compact bodies. They have overlarge eyes that help them see in the darkness of the deep places and large noses to help them sniff out trouble.
Gnomes find the light of the sun painful, so they wear thick goggles over their eyes. They cover their chalky skin in heavy clothing that includes tall, pointed caps, long coats that drag the ground, and heavy boots to anchor them to the earth—many gnomes believe that if they doff their clothing, they’ll float away into the endless blue.
**Dwellers in the Deep:** Until recently, gnomes lived in caves deep underground. Their homes feature high, vaulted ceilings supported by carved columns, walls studded with jewels of impossible size and deposits of precious metals that would cause any dwarf to break out in a sweat. Tunnels riddle their communities, burrowing through the rock for miles. A few underground communities remain, but the devastation that ravaged their homes drove most to the surface, and they have slowly spread across the Northern Reach finding homes in Crossings, Sixton, and elsewhere.
**Brave New World:** The gnomes were unprepared for the disaster that erased their homeland. Normally shy, reclusive, and private, the catastrophe thrust them into a strange and alien landscape, one with boundless emptiness stretching above. Uncertainty about the future, combined with the strangeness of their new homes, afflicts gnomes with great anxiety.
For all their fears, they remain a people curious, eager to learn about the world and how things work. Most gnomes have managed to overcome their fears and misgivings and now see the possibilities in front of them.
**Strangers in a Strange Land:** Gnomes have little experience dealing with the people dwelling in the world above. Refugees have spilled into the Northern Reach where they encountered the humans who have either welcomed them or at least tolerated their arrival. Prior to their emergence, the gnomes came into conflict with dwarfs at various times in the past, usually as a result of prospectors drawing too close to their enclaves. Other than these peoples, gnomes are strangers to the surface world and have yet to form opinions about the people who live here.
**Tongue of Earth and Stone:** Spoken almost exclusively by gnomes, it is close enough to the language spoken by sylphs, undines, and salamanders that they can usually make themselves understood to one another. The written form of gnomish uses patterns of dots and lines in place of characters.
