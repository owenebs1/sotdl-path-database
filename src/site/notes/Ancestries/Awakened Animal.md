Occasionally, an animal from the mortal world will find its way into the maze and become trapped. It may have swam up a river into the maze, or wandered in through a doorway or portal, or have been transported there by a merchant and escaped. Those who live long enough within the goblin king's realm are eventually morphed by the magic of the maze. Some of those become intelligent, gain the ability to speak, and gain hands with opposable thumbs to grasp and manipulate doors, locks, and other intricate things.
**Animals First** Awakened animals exhibit attitudes and characteristics of their original form. Despite gaining intelligence, many have difficulty understanding human and fey culture or etiquette. Over time, they could learn the cultures of others, but they always maintain characteristics of their animal origins. To determine your animal's type, roll or choose on the animal type table to see what kind of animal first entered the maze. Use the Animal Characteristics traits to help define and showcase your animal. While most awakened animals have traits typical for their animal type, all awakened animals are products of magic; thus, some may find themselves with traits uncharacteristic of their kind.
**Shaped by Magic** The magic of the faerie realm and the goblin king shape these animals into different versions of themselves. Some have their front paws turn into hands, others grow new limbs. Some are shaped into vaguely humanoid shape, while others have their size altered. Along with physical changes, the magic can alter their mindset as well, making some docile or more violent depending on the goblin king's mood when the magic changed them. But all become intelligent and gain the ability to speak.
Depending on your starting animal, your size may change. Roll or choose on the build table to determine what size the goblin king's magic has made you. Then roll or choose on the shape alterations table to see how the magic has altered your basic animal form.

You have more usable limbs than other animals. If you choose an additional pairs of legs, wings, or fins, then gain a +1 bonus to one type of Speed for each time you select this trait.

### Flying
When you move, you can fly. You must land at the end of your movement. If you select this trait a second time, you gain the flier trait so long as you are not injured.
### Jumper
You triple your jump distance. If you select this trait again, jumping does not provoke free attacks.
### Natural Armor
You have hard scales or a shell. Gain +1 Defense for each time you select this trait.
### Natural Weapons
You have some sort of natural weapon, such as claws, bite, quills, or stinger. Your natural weapon is a basic finesse weapon that deals 1d3 damage. You can take this trait a second time to improve the damage to 1d6.
### Poisonous
When you are damaged by an unarmed or natural weapon, your attacker must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, they take 1d3 damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A target that is already poisoned takes 1d3 extra damage. If you select this trait a second time, increase the damage to 1d6.

### Sightless

Creatures within the area cannot hide from you, and you ignore banes imposed by obscurement on rolls to perceive things. You are immune to the blinded affliction. If you select this trait a second time, extend the range to long.
### Venomous
Targets of your natural weapon must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, it takes 1d3 damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. If the target is already poisoned, it takes 1d3 extra damage. If you select this trait a second time, increase the damage to 1d6.
