### Apply all of the following traits to your character.

**Attributes** You do not have a Strength score. You cannot physically interact with objects, creatures, or your environment. You are immune to any attack or effect that would target your Strength score or that can be resisted with a success on a Strength challenge roll.
**Characteristics** Increase your Perception score by 2.
Reduce your Health score by the Strength score you had when you died. Recalculate your healing rate based on this new score. Finally, discard your Insanity score.
You are no longer at risk of gaining Insanity as you are already mad.
**Frightening** A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees you. The creature makes the roll with 1 bane if it sees four or more frightening creatures at the same time. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened for a number or rounds equal to 1d3 + its Insanity total.
Once a creature makes this roll, it becomes immune to your frightening trait until it completes a rest. Members of your group that get a success on the challenge roll become permanently immune to your frightening trait.
**Darksight** You can see in areas obscured by shadows and darkness within medium range as if those areas were lit.
Beyond this distance, you treat darkness as shadows and shadows as lit.
**Immune** damage from cold, disease, fire, and poison; asleep, blinded, deafened, diseased, fatigued, immobilized, poisoned, slowed
**Insubstantial** You take half damage from weapons. You ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain and you can move through solid objects and other creatures.
**Naturally Invisible** You are invisible to all creatures other than spirits, animals, and children. While invisible, you lose the frightening trait and you cannot use actions or triggered actions to attack.
**Ghostly Equipment** You have ghostly copies of everything you wore and carried at the moment of your death. If you drop an item, it vanishes from existence. Ghostly armor protects you as it did when you were alive and your weapons deal half the damage they did when you were alive.
**Manifestation** You can use an action to remove your Naturally Invisible trait, which causes you to become visible. You can use an action to end this effect.
**Bound by Remains** You cannot move or be moved more than 20 yards from your bodyâ€™s remains. If your remains are moved more than 20 yards from you, you take 1d6 damage at the end of each round until you are within 20 yards of your remains again. If this damage would cause you to become incapacitated, your soul descends to whatever fate it earned in life.
**Reformation** When you become incapacitated, you do not make fate rolls. Instead, you disappear from existence.
If you are within 20 yards of your remains when you disappear in this way, you return to existence in a space of your choice within 1 yard of your remains 24 hours later. Otherwise, you find your fate in the Underworld or Hell, depending on your Corruption score.
## Level 4 Expert Ghost
You learn one spell or gain Swift Manifestation.
**Swift Manifestation** On your turn, you can use a triggered action to use your Manifestation trait or end its effect.
