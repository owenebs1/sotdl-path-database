You can choose ghost as an ancestry, or your character can become a ghost after dying in the middle of an adventure or at a crucial point in the campaign.
## Base Ancestry
Only mortal characters with souls can become ghosts, such as [[Ancestries/Human\|humans]], [[Ancestries/Clockwork\|clockworks]], [[Ancestries/Dwarf\|dwarfs]], and [[Ancestries/Orc\|orcs]].
Elementals (such as gnomes), faeries, changelings, and similar creatures cannot, either because they don’t have souls or because the soul cannot be parted from the flesh.
If you’re creating a new ghost character, first start with a mortal character. Run through the advancement process until your character has all the benefits for your group level. Then, kill your character. See Cause of Death for more details.
If you were playing a character of a suitable ancestry who died during an adventure, the GM might let you continue to play as a ghost, provided doing so makes sense in terms of the story. This lets you keep contributing to the story without having to stop play while the group waits for you to create a replacement character. Since death is a traumatic experience, not everyone might be able to come back, so the GM might call for a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a success, the character’s soul slips from the corpse and becomes a ghost. Otherwise, the character is irrevocably dead and the soul moves on.
## Cause of Death
You have to die to become a ghost. Your death might have been sudden and unexpected, from a shocking act of brutality, or you might have bled out slowly after being hacked, shot, or torn apart. You can use the Causes of Death table to determine the circumstances of your character’s death if you don’t already know them.

## Haunting
Something has to keep your spirit in the mortal world. Whether it’s a person for whom you are responsible, a circumstance you simply cannot move past, or a place to which you have strong ties, you haunt the thing that anchors you. The nature of the thing you choose to haunt restricts what you can do and where you go. It’s not recommended for player characters to be bound to a particular place, unless that place is the setting for the entire adventure or encompasses enough territory to allow the character to participate in the story. Instead, it’s best to choose something mobile such as a person—perhaps a loved one—or an object, such as your remains, which can be dumped in a bag and carried around. If you can’t decide, roll for a random result from the Hauntings table.

|d6| Haunting|
| --- | --- |
|1| One interesting thing you were carrying at the time of your death.|
|2 |A weapon, implement, or suit of armor that belonged to you.|
|3 |Your physical remains.|
|4 |Someone in your group you liked.|
|5 |Someone in your group who loved or respected you.|
|6 |Someone in your group you hated.|

## Appearance
Your death has left a mark on your spirit, shaping your soul’s appearance to those who can see you. At the very least, you appear as you did at the time of your death, but transparent. If you met a traumatic end, the ravages to your body show in your spiritual form, making you appear damaged and terrible to behold. Consider how you died and alter your physical appearance so that the circumstances of your death are immediately obvious to any who can see you.
## Psychology
You don’t experience dying and face an existence as a disembodied spirit without suffering some trauma. Your transition from life to death caused your sanity to buckle to the point of breaking. As a result, you gain a personality trait, a quality that reflects an unstable mind. You can choose whatever quirk you like, but it ought to reflect the experiences you had in life and the manner in which you died.
# Apply all of the following traits to your character.

**Attributes** You do not have a Strength score. You cannot physically interact with objects, creatures, or your environment. You are immune to any attack or effect that would target your Strength score or that can be resisted with a success on a Strength challenge roll.
**Characteristics** Increase your Perception score by 2.
Reduce your Health score by the Strength score you had when you died. Recalculate your healing rate based on this new score. Finally, discard your Insanity score.
You are no longer at risk of gaining Insanity as you are already mad.
**Frightening** A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees you. The creature makes the roll with 1 bane if it sees four or more frightening creatures at the same time. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened for a number or rounds equal to 1d3 + its Insanity total.
Once a creature makes this roll, it becomes immune to your frightening trait until it completes a rest. Members of your group that get a success on the challenge roll become permanently immune to your frightening trait.
**Darksight** You can see in areas obscured by shadows and darkness within medium range as if those areas were lit.
Beyond this distance, you treat darkness as shadows and shadows as lit.
**Immune** damage from cold, disease, fire, and poison; asleep, blinded, deafened, diseased, fatigued, immobilized, poisoned, slowed
**Insubstantial** You take half damage from weapons. You ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain and you can move through solid objects and other creatures.
**Naturally Invisible** You are invisible to all creatures other than spirits, animals, and children. While invisible, you lose the frightening trait and you cannot use actions or triggered actions to attack.
**Ghostly Equipment** You have ghostly copies of everything you wore and carried at the moment of your death. If you drop an item, it vanishes from existence. Ghostly armor protects you as it did when you were alive and your weapons deal half the damage they did when you were alive.
**Manifestation** You can use an action to remove your Naturally Invisible trait, which causes you to become visible. You can use an action to end this effect.
**Bound by Remains** You cannot move or be moved more than 20 yards from your body’s remains. If your remains are moved more than 20 yards from you, you take 1d6 damage at the end of each round until you are within 20 yards of your remains again. If this damage would cause you to become incapacitated, your soul descends to whatever fate it earned in life.
**Reformation** When you become incapacitated, you do not make fate rolls. Instead, you disappear from existence.
If you are within 20 yards of your remains when you disappear in this way, you return to existence in a space of your choice within 1 yard of your remains 24 hours later. Otherwise, you find your fate in the Underworld or Hell, depending on your Corruption score.
## Level 4 Expert Ghost
You learn one spell or gain Swift Manifestation.
**Swift Manifestation** On your turn, you can use a triggered action to use your Manifestation trait or end its effect.
