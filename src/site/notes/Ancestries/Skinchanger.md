All kinds of creatures can adopt different forms. Students of Primal magic and Transformation magic can become animals, clouds of mist, or even other people. Changelings can mask their natural appearance with the guise of a person they observe. Hideous broodlings can become clouds of biting and stinging insects, while nisse can balloon into giants. The most notorious of the shapechanging creatures, however, are the skinchangers, sometimes called weres, scions of the Horned Lord, or lycanthropes.
What sets the skinchangers apart from other shapeshifters is that they all bear a weighty curse. The source of their affliction’s origin varies with the telling, as revealed below, but in all cases it causes a beast to come forth, transforming the skinchanger into a wild and dangerous animal, or, sometimes something in between. The forms skinchangers take vary wildly, from wolves to leopards, ravens to rats, and just about everything else in between. If it walks, crawls, slithers, swims, or flies, somewhere in the world, there’s a skinchanger that can adopt its form.
**The Curse** The skinchanger curse has haunted the mortal peoples since they first spread across Rûl, leaving the stories about where it came from unreliable at best. However, the dominant religions have some of the most accepted explanations. Devotees of the Old Faith believe the Horned Lord laid the curse on mortals who poached sacred animals in his grove, causing those people to become the beasts they had slain. The Inquisition of the New God’s cult claims the skinchanger curse is one more manifestation of the corruption on the mortal soul, indicating a sullied heart and diseased mind. All servants of the gods count skinchangers as dangerous foes that can spread their vile curse to their followers.
Not all view skinchangers as a menace. Among the [[Ancestries/Woad\|Woad]], a wild, nomadic people that live in and around the Empire, skinchangers within their ranks are believed to be favored by their tribe’s patron spirit. That members of the tribe can sometimes adopt animal forms matching the spirit supports their claim, though even the Woad admit the rapacious, bloodthirsty skinchangers found outside their tribes are dangerous, possibly estranged kin driven mad by the loss of their custom and society.
All of these stories could be true, but in all likelihood, the curse’s origin probably belongs to the faeries. Many early encounters between the mortals and immortals were peaceful, even supernatural given that the gods of the Old Faith bear a striking resemblance to many of the great fey who now rule over the hidden kingdoms, yet many encounters ended in violence, clashes that ultimately contributed to the faeries decision to abandon the mortal world. Leaving a curse to transform their enemies into wild, destructive animals who preyed on other people is just the sort of vengeance angry faeries might concoct.
**Passing the Curse** Curses usually affect only the person on whom they are bestowed. In other words, they’re not infectious. Once you become cursed, you remain so until you find a way to lift it. The skinchanger curse is the big exception to the rule, however, as skinchangers can bestow it onto creatures they scratch or bite. Any living, mortal creature that becomes injured or incapacitated from damage dealt by a skinchanger’s natural weapons is at risk of gaining the skinchanger curse.
In addition, the curse can pass from one generation to the next. This is especially true for people with strong ties to the faerie or who live in or near lands steeped in faerie magic. Sometimes the curse passes directly from father to son, mother to daughter, or might wait one or more generations before a descendant discovers she carries the curse when, one night, she transforms in the light of the moon.
**The Effects of the Curse** The effects of becoming cursed by a skinchanger do not usually reveal themselves right away. The cursed creature often goes several days or weeks unaware of what will happen when the moon next rises full, although cravings for raw meat, fascination with the moon, and strange dreams of running with rats, wolves, or roaming about the wilderness under the cover of night are all common warning signs that something is wrong. Once the moon rises full, the cursed creature undergoes a painful transformation, joints popping, skin sliding, fur or feathers bursting from the pores until the victim becomes an animal in body and mind. This lasts until the moon sets, at which point the curse fades and the creature returns to its normal form, likely covered in blood, dirt, and grass stains. Henceforth, each time the moon rises full, the skinchanger transforms, and its mind shatters a bit more until it eventually becomes the monster it fears lurks within. from the pores until the victim becomes an animal in body and mind. This lasts 3
**Lifting the Curse** A few remedies exist for those who become enslaved to the moon. The best and most certain is to find the skinchanger responsible for passing the curse and kill it with a weapon made from silver. When the creature dies, the curse lifts from each creature to whom it was passed, but only from those who had not themselves passed the curse onto others.
Magic can also lift the curse. The remove curse spell from the Protection tradition has a chance to remove it. The caster must cast the spell on a target while it is in its animal or hybrid form. The target instantly returns to its normal, humanoid form, but the next time the moon rises full, the target must make a Will challenge roll. A success indicates the curse was removed successfully, while a failure indicates the attempt fails, and the target transforms as normal.
Finally, belladonna, known also as wolfsbane, might lift the curse. An uncommon herb commonly sold for 1d6 cp by apothecaries and some witches, it must be administered as a tincture once each day for seven nights leading up to the full moon.
Consuming the tincture causes the creature to take 1d6 damage and become poisoned until it completes a rest. However, when the full moon rises, the creature can make a Will challenge roll with 1 boon. On a success, the curse is lifted.
# Skinchanger Characters
Skinchangers, like vampires, tend to be adversaries and their presence in a group can be disruptive, at least until the skinchanger gains some control over the curse. If permitted in the campaign, you can either create a skinchanger from scratch or become a skinchanger after contracting the curse.
## Starting Ancestry
The skinchanger curse affects only living, mortal creatures such as [[Ancestries/Human\|humans]], [[Ancestries/Dwarf\|dwarfs]], [[Ancestries/Faun\|fauns]], [[Ancestries/Halfling\|halflings]], and [[Ancestries/Orc\|orcs]]. Other ancestries might also produce skinchangers at the GM’s discretion, but such ancestries must be living and not created by magic—so no vampires, clockworks, or changelings. You can create a new skinchanger character by first creating a character that belongs to a permitted ancestry. Once you finish, apply the following adjustments, traits, and talents to the character. You also apply them to a character who becomes a skinchanger in play.
## Attributes
**Bonuses:** Strength +1, Intellect -1
- - -
## Characteristics
**Perception:** +1
**Insanity:** +1d3
**Corruption:** +1
- - -
## Talents
**Silver Vulnerability:** When you take damage from a silver weapon, you take a penalty to Health equal to the damage. The penalty remains until after you complete a rest.
**Skinchanger Curse:** If you are in an area illuminated by light cast by a full moon at the end of the round, you become an animal. The kind of animal whose form you assume is determined either by the skinchanger that bestowed the curse if you gained it during play or by rolling on the Animal Form table when you create your character. You remain in this form until you are in an area lit by sunlight at the end of any round, at which point you immediately return to your normal form.
As you transform, you must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. For each level your group has attained, make the challenge roll with 1 boon.
Thus, if your group level is 1, you make the challenge roll with 2 banes. You control your character on a success, and the GM takes control of your character until you return to your normal form on a failure.
Under the GM’s control, you behave as a vicious animal. In either case, you use the animal’s statistics in place of your own, though if you got a success on the Will challenge roll, you use your Intellect and Will scores in place of the animal’s.
When you cause a living creature to become injured or incapacitated by an attack made with your natural weapons, that creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane the next time it’s in an area lit by a full moon or it too becomes a skinchanger.
Upon returning to your normal form, you must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, you gain 1d3 Insanity.

## Level 4 Benefits
**Characteristics:** Perception +1, Insanity +1d3, Corruption +1
You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or gain the Change Form talent.
**Change Form:** You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to adopt your normal form, your animal form, or a hybrid of your animal and humanoid forms. You remain in the new form until you use Change Form again or you become incapacitated, which causes you to return to your normal form immediately. The animal form must be the same as the form you adopt when under the effects of your Skinchanger Curse. If you adopt an animal form, use the animal’s statistics in place of your own, except you retain this talent and your Intellect and Will scores. If you adopt a hybrid form, you make the following adjustments to your statistics.
- You gain the frightening and shadowsight traits if you don’t have them already.
>**Frightening** A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees one or more creatures with this trait. It makes the roll with 1 bane if it can see four or more frightening creatures at once.
>**Shadowsight** The creature can see in areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.

- You gain a +2 bonus to Perception, a +2 bonus to Defense, +10 bonus to Health, and a +2 bonus to Speed.
- You make Strength and Agility attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.
- You gain Regeneration, allowing you to heal 1d6 damage at the end of each round if not incapacitated.
- You have natural weapons as appropriate to your animal form—teeth, claws, horns—that function as basic weapons with the finesse property and deal 1d6 damage.
