## Attributes
**Bonuses:** Strength +1, Intellect -1
- - -
## Characteristics
**Perception:** +1
**Insanity:** +1d3
**Corruption:** +1

## Talents
**Silver Vulnerability:** When you take damage from a silver weapon, you take a penalty to Health equal to the damage. The penalty remains until after you complete a rest.
**Skinchanger Curse:** If you are in an area illuminated by light cast by a full moon at the end of the round, you become an animal. The kind of animal whose form you assume is determined either by the skinchanger that bestowed the curse if you gained it during play or by rolling on the Animal Form table when you create your character. You remain in this form until you are in an area lit by sunlight at the end of any round, at which point you immediately return to your normal form.
As you transform, you must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. For each level your group has attained, make the challenge roll with 1 boon.
Thus, if your group level is 1, you make the challenge roll with 2 banes. You control your character on a success, and the GM takes control of your character until you return to your normal form on a failure.
Under the GM’s control, you behave as a vicious animal. In either case, you use the animal’s statistics in place of your own, though if you got a success on the Will challenge roll, you use your Intellect and Will scores in place of the animal’s.
When you cause a living creature to become injured or incapacitated by an attack made with your natural weapons, that creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane the next time it’s in an area lit by a full moon or it too becomes a skinchanger.
Upon returning to your normal form, you must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, you gain 1d3 Insanity.

## Level 4 Benefits
**Characteristics:** Perception +1, Insanity +1d3, Corruption +1
You either learn one spell, gain the level 4 benefit from your ancestry, or gain the Change Form talent.
**Change Form:** You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to adopt your normal form, your animal form, or a hybrid of your animal and humanoid forms. You remain in the new form until you use Change Form again or you become incapacitated, which causes you to return to your normal form immediately. The animal form must be the same as the form you adopt when under the effects of your Skinchanger Curse. If you adopt an animal form, use the animal’s statistics in place of your own, except you retain this talent and your Intellect and Will scores. If you adopt a hybrid form, you make the following adjustments to your statistics.
- You gain the frightening and shadowsight traits if you don’t have them already.
>**Frightening** A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees one or more creatures with this trait. It makes the roll with 1 bane if it can see four or more frightening creatures at once.
>**Shadowsight** The creature can see in areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.

- You gain a +2 bonus to Perception, a +2 bonus to Defense, +10 bonus to Health, and a +2 bonus to Speed.
- You make Strength and Agility attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.
- You gain Regeneration, allowing you to heal 1d6 damage at the end of each round if not incapacitated.
- You have natural weapons as appropriate to your animal form—teeth, claws, horns—that function as basic weapons with the finesse property and deal 1d6 damage.
