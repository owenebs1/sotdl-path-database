## Talents
**Immune:** damage from cold, disease, poison; asleep, diseased, fatigued, immobilized, poisoned, and slowed
**Darksight:** You can see in areas obscured by shadows and darkness within medium range as if those areas were lit.
Beyond this distance, you treat darkness as shadows and shadows as lit.
**Sire-Bound:** You are bound to the vampire that created you until it uses an action to free you or it is destroyed.
You cannot attack the vampire that made you, and you become compelled by it while it is within short range of you.
**Dreadful Appearance:** When you attack a living creature that can see you, the target must make a Will challenge roll. The target becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failure. On a success, it becomes immune to your Dreadful Appearance until after it completes a rest.
**Natural Weapons:** You have long fangs, which count as swift fi nesse weapons that deal 1d6 damage.
**Unnatural Existence:** Your healing rate is 0 and cannot be increased above 0.
**Blood Pool:** You need blood to sustain your existence. You measure the blood you have accumulated in a pool of blood points. When you fi rst become a vampire, you gain 1 blood point from the vampire that created you.
You add blood points to your pool using the Drink Blood talent (see below) up to a maximum number equal to 1 + your group level.
Each time you complete a rest, you must spend 1 point from your blood pool. If you have no blood points to spend, you gain 1 Insanity and take a –1d6 penalty to Health (minimum 0; see Torpor below). The penalty is cumulative, and you are impaired while you have it. You can remove the accumulated penalty to Health by using an action to spend 1 blood point.
**Blood Healing:** You can use an action or a triggered action on your turn to expend 1 blood point and heal damage equal to 1 + your group level.
**Torpor:** When the penalty to your Health from the Blood Pool trait drops your Health to 0, you become unconscious, resembling a corpse. If you take any damage while unconscious, you are instantly destroyed.
As an action, another creature can feed you fresh blood from a living creature to remove the accumulated penalty to your Health and end this affliction.
**Drink Blood:** When a living creature you have grabbed takes damage from an attack using your fangs, the creature takes a penalty to its Health equal to its healing rate for 1 hour, and you add 1 point to your blood pool.
While the creature has this penalty, it is fatigued.
**Superstition:** While you can see the object of your superstitious fear (see below), you make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 3 banes.
**Burned by Sunlight:** You take 2d6 damage and reduce your blood pool by 1 at the end of each round you are in an area lit by sunlight. As well, you take double damage from Celestial spells and make challenge rolls to resist those spells with 1 bane.

## Level 4 Benefits

**Pass for Human:** You can use an action to alter your appearance so that you look as you did in the prime of your life. You keep this appearance until you take damage, you attack, or you use an action to resume your normal appearance.

# Creating New Vampires
To create a “child,” or vampire brood, you must drain blood from a living human until it becomes incapacitated and then feed the victim your blood by using an action and spending 1 blood point. The victim dies at the end of the round. If the corpse is exposed to sunlight, it instantly burns to ash. If, however, the corpse is interred somewhere the light cannot reach, such as a tomb or a crypt, it rises as a new vampire when the sun next sets.
