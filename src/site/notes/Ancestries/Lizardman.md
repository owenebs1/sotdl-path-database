Of the serpent people, few survived intact, though rumors persist of colonies hidden throughout the lands. Most forgot the old ways and slid into savage barbarism, becoming little better than the brutes they had once enslaved. Now known as lizardmen, these peoples haunt the ruins of their fallen empire. They make their homes in pestilential swamps and primeval forests. Fiercely territorial, the lizardmen know on a deep, instinctive level that they cannot leave their home, but they do not know why this is.
They know that they must stay close, and that they harbor an inherent hatred for outsiders. Xenophobic and indiscriminately carnivorous, few people survive the discovery of a lizardman village. And those that do, often wish they hadn’t.
**Echoes of Ancient Glory:** Time has not been kind to lizardmen’s fallen empire and little remains to suggest they were ever anything more than they are now. This said, archeologists do happen upon the occasional artifact that offers clues about their scientific and magical achievements, while ziggurats, monoliths, and other remnants can still be found in the depths of trackless swamps and untouched forests. In such places, fabulous treasures might remain, if one is willing to brave the lizardmen who haunt the ruins.
**Aggressively Territorial:** Few people have seen a lizardman village and lived to tell about it. The lizardmen keep to themselves, but seem to have a supernatural sense for when someone has crossed their borders. They give no quarter to intruders and subject their prisoners to unspeakable torments, flaying them, boiling them alive, eating them, or worse. The lucky ones manage to cut their own throats before the lizardmen catch them, but those few who manage to escape are never the same—the scars are deeper than flesh, and there is a bizarre tendency for survivors to come to believe they themselves are lizardmen.
**Sadistic and Savage:** Lizardmen go out of their way to ensure their victims live as long as possible. Shamans know enough herbalism or might possess rudimentary healing magic to keep their victims alive while flaying, cooking, and dismembering them.
Lizardmen demonstrate no small amount of glee in breaking limbs and setting bones just to break them again several days later once the healing process has begun. Lizardmen sometimes remove the skull and spine of one of their victims to retain as a trophy; being able to remove these grisly elements while other potential victims watch enhances the value of this trophy.
**Festering Communities:** A lizardman village is rarely more than a collection of crude mounds of mud and reedy huts, often partially submerged in stagnant, standing water and almost always located in the shadow of a monument or crumbling building from their lost empire. There is no hint here of what once built them into power, as all that can be seen is scraps and refuse.
**Wicked Traps:** Although the lizardmen might appear to be dumb brutes, they are anything but. Crafty and cunning, lizardmen take great, obscene pleasure in creating traps to maim and capture 3 trespassers. If these traps inflict grievous wounds or cause the death of the trespasser, so much the better: dinner is served.
Lizardmen use dart traps, poisoned needles, concealed pits, and spear traps, but their most commonly deployed trap is a variation of the standard concealed spiked pit (Shadow, 203). The spikes at the bottom of the pit are covered with sticky, semi-dried excrement. Often this putrid coating is provided by the lizardmen directly, but occasionally they drop unwanted visitors into the pit and let nature take its course over the following few days, adding rotting bodies to the offal and poisonous blend of bodily juices that they liberally apply to the trap’s spiked floor. A person that falls into one of these foul creations is often subject to infection (Shadow, 201) or at the very least is subjected to virulent poison (Shadow, 107) in addition to taking lethal damage.
