In a land far from Rûl, perhaps even in another world, at a time long ago when little separated humankind from the animals, stood the powerful empire of Valossa, unmatched in magic and technology and populated by a race of serpent people who had enslaved all the younger races that dwelled in their lands. The descendants of those people have spread across the world, staying hidden from view and biding their time until the day when they can rise up and reclaim their rightful place as masters of Urth.
**Reptilian Humanoids:** Serpent people, a general term used for Valossans, combine the features of snakes and humans. Typical individuals stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds. Their slender bodies have short limbs that end in clawed digits. Serpent people have the heads of snakes, with some rare examples having the hoods of cobras as well. From the base of the spine extends a long tail that drags on the ground.
**Children of Yig:** The serpent people owed their empire and its advances to the beneficence of their god, Yig, a serpentine deity who has largely passed from memory. So long as the Valossans served the snake god, they prospered, but when the Demon Lord’s shadow fell upon them, when arrogance led to corruption, Yig became angry and cast them down, shattering their empire and scattering the survivors across the world. Many serpent people became debased and degenerate, having forgotten who they were. Others evolved into different creatures, such as the lizardmen found in the swamps of Rûl. A few, though, managed to preserve their heritage and keep their traditions alive well enough to have the hope of one day rebuilding their civilization and returning to their exalted place as Yig’s favored people.
**A Divided People:** Views on what to do to save their kind deeply divide the intelligent serpent people. A few cling to the worship of Yig, recalling their god as a good and virtuous deity, but a sect called the Sskethvai has grown to prominence. Its leaders deliver fiery sermons to embolden the serpent people to take the world by force and enslave the weaker peoples living there. The sect has had some success in gaining converts, and its actions have drawn attention from certain powerful figures. Many serpent people now live in the caves and sewers beneath the city of Freeport; it is believed that long ago one of their greatest cities sank off the coast of the Serpent’s Teeth. Most serpent people found in the city are degenerates, mad and vicious, but a few cling to the tattered remains of their civilization. Some worship the snake god Yig, while others are fully in the thrall of the Unspeakable One. In fact, serpent people played a key part in the efforts to summon forth the Unspeakable One from the Void (as detailed in the Freeport Trilogy). Now, serpent people of all motivations move in secret inside Freeport and elsewhere to shift history’s course in their favor.
**Shapechangers:** As a naturally magical people, serpent people can alter their physical form to assume the appearance of other humanoid-shaped creatures. This ability was useful to the Valossans as they fled the destruction of their homeland, and remains so now as they seek to gather information about the present world and the peoples they once called their slaves. Unlike faeries that can change their shapes, serpent people have nothing to fear from iron and can remain in their changed forms for as long as they remain conscious.
**Degenerate Serpent People:** Serpent people who succumb to the temptations of darkness tend to lose their minds and devolve, becoming hideous degenerates that live little better than beasts in dark and dank places. This vulnerability could be a curse laid on them by their god, or it might be a side effect of their magical nature, but whatever the cause, serpent people who give in to dark temptations suffer the transformation. Part of the reason that degenerate serpent people are more common than others is that serpent people do not shed Corruption when they die. Instead, the darkness stays with their souls and inhabits their new bodies. Thus, when a degenerate dies, it’s almost a sure thing that a newly hatched serpent person will also be a degenerate.

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | You hear voices in your head that push you toward evil action. You have urges to kill, maim, and brutalize others, and it’s but a matter of time before you give in.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4–5   | You despise humans and other peoples. You have heard the stories of ancient times when they were your people’s slaves. Your towering arrogance offends most people you meet.                                                                                                                                            |
| 6–8   | You crave power, and you’ll do anything to get it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 9–12  | You escaped the horrors that have befallen your people and now, like others, hope to restore the Valossans to their former greatness. You don’t have much of an opinion about other peoples; you are willing to treat them as they treat you, though part of you sees them as being little better than talking animals. |
| 13–15 | You seek to reclaim the glory of ancient Valossa and are interested in recovering your people’s lost lore and technology.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16–17 | You recognize the rampant corruption in your people and resist the temptation that darkness offers. You strive to do good.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18    | You have a good heart and hope to leave the world a better place than you found it. Chiefly, you struggle to free your degenerate kin from the corruption that stains their souls and restore their minds                                                                                                               |
