| 1   | You fought the trolls thousands of years ago.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | You were a child stolen from your parents by the faerie and raised among them, losing your humanity to become an elf.                                                                                     |
| 3   | You chose to live apart from your kind, finding refuge in the unspoiled wilderness of the mortal world.                                                                                                   |

| 11  | Pleasure has ruled your life, and you have few memories of the times you have spent indulging your every desire.                                                                                          |
| 12  | You have traveled among mortals, and you have a better understanding of their nature than do the rest of your people.                                                                                     |
| 13  | You have the Faerie Queen’s favor. She watches what you do from time to time in a reflecting pool.                                                                                                        |

| 17  | You have confused pain for pleasure, spending 1d20 years mutilating your body.                                                                                                                            |
| 18  | You come from a people who refused to abandon the mortal world. You are deemed primitive and backward by other elves.                                                                                     |
| 19  | Demons spilled into your homeland, and you are the sole survivor.                                                                                                                                         |
| 20  | You fell in love with a mortal and murdered his or her loved ones so that he or she would love only you. Gain 1d3 Corruption.                                                                             |
