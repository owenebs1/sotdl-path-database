## Apotheosis Spores
Saprophicans reproduce by infecting living creatures with apotheosis spores released from their bodies.
An infected creature experiences difficulty breathing, developing a wet cough resulting from the spores growing in its lungs and throat. In a matter of days, the spores kill the creature, taking over its body.
**Transmission** A creature that breathes in spores becomes exposed. One hour later, the creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or suffer the stage 1 effects of the apotheosis spores.
**Cure** Only magic of rank 3 or higher can cure this infection.
- **Stage 0** The creature recovers from apotheosis spores.
- **Stage 1** The creature is diseased.
- **Stage 2** As stage 1, but whenever the creature uses an action or a triggered action, the creature becomes fatigued for 1 round.
- **Stage 3** The creature’s Intellect and Will drop to 5.
	It loses all professions, talents, and spells learned.
	The creature becomes compelled by the spores, and usually goes some place secret and safe to complete the transformation. After 1d3 months, the creature transforms into a new saprophican and retains none of its original statistics.
**Recovery** Each time the diseased creature completes a rest and is at a stage less than 3, it must make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes.
- 20 or more: The creature moves down one stage.
- Success: No change.
- Failure: The creature moves up one stage.
- 0 or less: The creature moves up two stages.

# Saprophican Appearance

| 3d6   | Appearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | You were unable to fully transform your host’s body and now appear as a grim amalgamation of fungal flesh, scraps of fur, and twisted, disjointed bones. You are repulsive to others and are met with horrified expressions and screams everywhere you go. |
| 4–5   | You appear almost human, with a monstrous deformity from your transformation. You might hobble and limp with a warped leg, one arm may be drastically shorter than the other, or you might be missing an eye and your lips.                                |
| 6–8   | You appear human, but you stand almost upright, and your face is more fungus than man. Your approximation of the human form is unsettling to others.                                                                                                       |
| 9–12  | Your body and facial features are human but have strange patterns and textures. Your host’s skeleton, or some other feature of your true nature easily reveals you to be something else entirely.                                                          |
| 13–15 | You appear to be human in passing, but anyone who interacts with you is soon disabused of that notion.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 16–17 | From a distance, you appear to be an attractive human, but up close the strange texture of your flesh mars the facade.                                                                                                                                     |
| 18    | Your body is perfectly sculpted to appear to be an extraordinarily beautiful human. Only close inspection, and your fungal adornments, would suggest otherwise.                                                                                            |

| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | You are a parasite. People are a resource to you and you will take from them until there is nothing left. You despise those who stand in your way. |
| 4–5   | Suspicion of other people drives your every action. You are always looking over your shoulder.                                                     |
| 6–8   | You are well-meaning but lack social skills and come off as arrogant or overbearing.                                                               |
| 9–12  | You are generally amiable, but you have trouble overcoming your selfish nature.                                                                    |
| 13–15 | You are friendly and find it easy to make friends.                                                                                                 |
| 16–17 | You are outgoing and strive to make as many friends as you can.                                                                                    |
| 18    | You have a magnetic personality and often find people hang on your every word.                                                                     |

| 4   | You have broken two of your bones and are now seeking replacements.                                                                                         |

| 9   | The Mother Spore came to you in a vision and showed you where you should found a new colony. You have since forgotten the directions.                       |
| 10  | Your colony disregards saprophican law and preys on humans and other humanoid creatures.                                                                    |
