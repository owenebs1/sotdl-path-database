Few people have ever met a saprophican and those who have seldom met another. Nearly all of the fungus folk live in small, isolated colonies in dense forests far from settled lands. Fear of discovery, distrust of others’ motives, and superstition keep most saprophicans close to their homes. Still, at some point in their lives, they are compelled to venture forth and travel out from their hidden places in order to found new colonies.
Mishap and violence most often abbreviate these trips, which is why so few saprohicans are ever seen. From time to time, one or two emerge from the wild and venture into civilized lands. Despite the fears some people in the lands of Rûl have against strange and alien beings, the saprophicans find they are usually able to integrate well with humanoids. Affable, charming, and convincing are all traits common among them, which helps to allay any fears about their intentions. Once they find acceptance, they can begin work on their true purpose: establishing a new saprophican colony.
**Colony Builders:** As all fungus exists to spread its spores, so too do the saprophicans. When saprophicans reach maturity, they experience an intense desire to leave their colony and establish new ones. They have evolved humanoid shapes out of necessity, since these forms are far less likely to be mistaken for something dangerous or abhorrent. In fact, ages ago, saprophicans appeared as animals, only twisted and bent to walk on two legs. The early human tribes either fled in fear or cut them down, thinking they were monsters.
Saprophicans embellish their forms with decorative growths. Vibrant crowns of finger-like mushrooms adorn their heads, bioluminescent frills shed soft light, and blooms sweeten the air around them. Once they ingratiate themselves with the settlement and squash any misgivings, they integrate with the host settlement, subsisting on the work of their neighbors as much as possible. While not an inherently lazy people, they prefer to work as little as possible themselves when others can toil on their behalf. Eventually, they direct their new community to help secure a suitable location for a new colony. Some of the most successful of their kind have convinced whole towns to take up arms and root out bands of beastmen inhabiting what they considered to be a choice site.
If they are able to find a suitable and safe location, with fertile ground in which to grow new life, they start work on creating a new colony, which comes at the price of their own lives. Their bodies break down to release a cloud of spores that settles into the earth, where they then grow into the mycelia that covers each colony. The mycelia connect with each other and draw out nutrients from the ground to funnel into the husk the saprophican left behind. It is from this husk that the center of all saprophican colonies grows, a great monument to their god, the Mother Spore. Contained within this pillar are enough spores to infect a dozen new hosts from any creature unfortunate to have made their dens near this new colony.
**Hidden Homes:** A dense web of mycelium surrounds each colony. Not only do the mycelium alert the colony of trespassers by releasing spores of its own, but also works as trap for anything foolish enough to come too close. The tendrils wrap around the legs of animals, entrapping them in fungal nets. Saprophicans then infect these unfortunate creatures, leaving them trapped while the spores take hold. The mycelium swaddles the beast until the newly formed saprophican is created, and the body is fit to carry back to the colony’s heart. The fungus folk are intensely secretive about their true origins, rightly believing it would turn others against them if their reproduction cycle became common knowledge.
This secrecy extends to the point that their society forbids the infection of an intelligent creature with the saprophican fungus. If a child goes missing in the woods, the whole village searches for it, while no one will miss a deer. Any who break this law are burned alive until there is not even a spore left of them. However, this does not stop the saprophicans from killing any trespassers who might escape to reveal their dreadful secret.
**Parasitic Genesis:** The spores take root in the lungs of any creature who inhales them. Over the next few days, the spores sprout fine web-like strands of mycelium down into the lungs and up the throat, through the nasal cavity, and then into the brain along the olfactory nerve. After the mycelium borrowed into the brain, the host is inexorably drawn towards the nearest saprophican colony, where the rest of the transformation can take place in solitude and safety. By this point, whoever or whatever the host’s identity or original existence was is lost, destroyed by the fungal takeover of all the brain’s functions.
Once at the colony, the fungus begins to alter the host body, spreading through veins and between muscles, while contorting the animal’s figure into a humanoid shape. Dense fungal growths fill the gaps left by this process, and over time it builds a full body for itself using its host as food and fertilizer. The animal’s bones are kept intact and used as a rudimentary skeleton, as saprophicans are unable to produce a fungus dense enough to replace them. Often, they will seek out new bones to serve as a more suitable skeleton, slowly incorporating them over a few days, and, being unable to repair these bones themselves, replacements must be sought out for any breaks.
**Strange Diets:** Despite their efforts to integrate with the mortals of Urth by taking on superficially reassuring forms, they have not yet been able to mask one aspect of their biology. Saprophicans are ravenous carnivores, 3 unable to eat anything but raw meat. They have a specialized fungal “stomach” that putrefies the meat before digesting it, which causes each saprophican to smell slightly of decay shortly after each meal.
**A Forgotten God:** Each colony still worships the same god, the Mother Spore, and a shrine to this goddess—a giant pillar of slick, black fungus—stands at the center of every community. Saprophicans believe it was from her they were spawned. The Mother Spore is a grim uncaring figure of death, decay, and rebirth. She compels her brood to spread their spores to the furthest corners of the continent, and with the Shadow of the Demon Lord touching even their secluded homes, saprophicans are leaving their colonies in greater numbers. The few scholars who have been able to study saprophican religion—and did not pay with their life for it—believe it is simply a distant offshoot of the ancient World Mother cult. Instead of fertility and vitality, their sect venerated decay as the start of all life and rebirth. While each colony’s beliefs vary in the details, they all believe that the Mother Spore is something entirely other than the World Mother. Priests of the Mother Spore have access to the Death, Life, and Nature traditions.

# Apotheosis Spores
Saprophicans reproduce by infecting living creatures with apotheosis spores released from their bodies.
An infected creature experiences difficulty breathing, developing a wet cough resulting from the spores growing in its lungs and throat. In a matter of days, the spores kill the creature, taking over its body.
**Transmission** A creature that breathes in spores becomes exposed. One hour later, the creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes or suffer the stage 1 effects of the apotheosis spores.
**Cure** Only magic of rank 3 or higher can cure this infection.
- **Stage 0** The creature recovers from apotheosis spores.
- **Stage 1** The creature is diseased.
- **Stage 2** As stage 1, but whenever the creature uses an action or a triggered action, the creature becomes fatigued for 1 round.
- **Stage 3** The creature’s Intellect and Will drop to 5.
	It loses all professions, talents, and spells learned.
	The creature becomes compelled by the spores, and usually goes some place secret and safe to complete the transformation. After 1d3 months, the creature transforms into a new saprophican and retains none of its original statistics.
**Recovery** Each time the diseased creature completes a rest and is at a stage less than 3, it must make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes.
- 20 or more: The creature moves down one stage.
- Success: No change.
- Failure: The creature moves up one stage.
- 0 or less: The creature moves up two stages.

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | You were unable to fully transform your host’s body and now appear as a grim amalgamation of fungal flesh, scraps of fur, and twisted, disjointed bones. You are repulsive to others and are met with horrified expressions and screams everywhere you go. |
| 4–5   | You appear almost human, with a monstrous deformity from your transformation. You might hobble and limp with a warped leg, one arm may be drastically shorter than the other, or you might be missing an eye and your lips.                                |
| 6–8   | You appear human, but you stand almost upright, and your face is more fungus than man. Your approximation of the human form is unsettling to others.                                                                                                       |
| 9–12  | Your body and facial features are human but have strange patterns and textures. Your host’s skeleton, or some other feature of your true nature easily reveals you to be something else entirely.                                                          |
| 13–15 | You appear to be human in passing, but anyone who interacts with you is soon disabused of that notion.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 16–17 | From a distance, you appear to be an attractive human, but up close the strange texture of your flesh mars the facade.                                                                                                                                     |
| 18    | Your body is perfectly sculpted to appear to be an extraordinarily beautiful human. Only close inspection, and your fungal adornments, would suggest otherwise.                                                                                            |
