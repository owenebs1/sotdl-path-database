## Talents
**Immune:** damage from disease or poison; diseased, poisoned
**Shadowsight:** You see in areas obscured by shadows as if those areas were lit.
**Dreadful Appearance:** When you attack a living creature that can see you, the target creature must make a Will challenge roll. The creature becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failure or becomes immune to your Dreadful Appearance until after it completes a rest on a success.
**Unholy Feast:** You can use an action to eat one dead creature you can reach, which requires concentrating for 1 minute. At the end of this time, you utterly consume the target corpse, and you assume its living appearance until you complete a rest. While you have this appearance, you lose the Dreadful Appearance talent.
**Accursed Compulsion:** At the end of each round that you are within short range of a dead creature, you must make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, you must move toward the dead creature and use your Unholy Feast talent when you are next able. Once you do so, you lose Accursed Compulsion for 1 hour.
**Fear of the Gods:** Against creatures wearing or wielding religious symbols or icons you make attack rolls with 1 bane. In addition, you become frightened while on areas of holy ground (see Uncertain Faith) and remain frightened for as long as you remain there.
**Powerful Ancestry:** When your group attains level 1, you do not choose a novice path. Instead, whenever the Advancement table indicates you would gain benefits from a novice path, you gain the benefits from your ancestry for that level.
If you already chose a novice path before you became a ghoul, remove the path and any benefits you gained from that path, starting with the benefits gained at the highest level and then working backwards. For each set of benefits lost in this way, you gain 1 Insanity.

# Becoming a Ghoul
Only living creatures not immune to the diseased aﬄiction can become ghouls. Humans are the most common, but it’s possible for fauns, halflings, and dwarfs to suﬀer the curse. Characters with the Powerful Ancestry trait cannot become ghouls.
If you belong to an ancestry capable of transforming into a ghoul and you consume the flesh from a creature, alive or dead, who shares your ancestry, you must roll a d6.
On a 1, you become defenseless for 1d6 hours and then transform into a ghoul.
On a 2–5, you suﬀer no ill eﬀect.
On a 6, you suﬀer no ill eﬀect and you are not at risk of becoming a ghoul until after you complete a rest.
Upon becoming a ghoul, you apply all of the above traits to your character.
