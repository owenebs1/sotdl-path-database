When Father Death comes to claim the soul of the newly dead, sometimes that soul refuses the call and escapes the hook that would drag it into the Underworld. Either by the intercession of magic, a terrible curse, or some act of supreme willpower, the soul returns to the meat and restores it to a semblance of life, becoming undead. Grave thralls represent just one of the many forms of undead that might result from such refusals and are the most likely fate for characters who cannot yet move on.
**Walking Dead:** As undead, grave thralls walk a road between life and death. They can move, think, and experience much as they did in life, but their organs no longer work and begin to decay inside the husks of their bodies. Their eyes being the first to go, the magic sustaining them manifests in the dark sockets as pinpricks of blue light. Their skin turns waxy, graying until it draws tight over the bones. Internal organs liquefy and spill out of their withered orifices, leaving them hollowed out and empty.

### Kingdom of Skulls Backgrounds
|d20| Background|
|---|---|
|1 |Your family turned to cannibalism to avoid starvation. You were chosen to be eaten, but you ran away.|
|2 |Your father was a soldier in the Dark Lady’s armies. He died in battle, but his corpse was turned into a grave thrall. You still see him from time to time.|
|3| You joined the Cult of the Dark Lady, pledging your soul to the mistress of the land.|
|4 |Your grandmother’s spirit haunted your home. You’d spy her out of the corner of your eye from time to time. She seemed to delight in scaring you.|
|5 |You were captured by slavers in the Patchwork Lands but won your freedom in the fighting pits. You traveled west to find your fortune.|
|6| You believe your ancestors were among those who traveled through Hell with the Dark Lady.|
|7 |You secretly hate the Kingdom of Skulls and the Dark Lady. You would do anything to escape this place.|
|8 |You were kidnapped by a woman who had lost her child and sought to make you its replacement.|
|9| You toiled on one of the kingdom’s farms, fighting to grow a meager crop.|
|10 |You traveled to Blötland and lived among the jotun for a time.|
|11| You have spent your life trying to earn the gift of undeath. One day, you might become worthy.|
|12 |The Dark Lady once singled you out in a crowd and spoke to you. You fell in love with her and pledged to serve her until the end of your days.|
|13 |A band of ghouls carried your sibling into the night. You can still hear his or her screams.|
|14| In the hopes of winning the Dark Lady’s favor, you sacrificed a sibling on an altar of stone. You gained nothing from the act but guilt.|
|15 |Centaurs attacked your village and killed everyone but you.|
|16 |You were a member of a band of brigands who crossed over the eastern border to raid the Patchwork Lands for supplies.|
|17 |Your mother was possessed by a demon. She tormented your family until you finally killed her. In doing so, you released the demon, and you believe it is still out there somewhere.|
|18 |You found a petrified troll in the mouth of an old cave high in the mountains. You fled when something stirred in the darkness, but you think you can remember where to find the cave if you want to return.|
|19 |A horrible monster came out from the Darkening Fen and threatened to ruin the crops. You joined with others to track the beast down and kill it.|
|20| You washed up on the western shores with no memory of who you are or from where you came.|

**Hateful Light:** Sunlight strains the magic that enables the soul to linger inside the grave thrall’s body. While in areas lit by sunlight, the soul’s grip on the body loosens and rattles about inside. As a result, the grave thrall becomes weakened and sluggish. Grave thralls withdraw from the sunlight so they can regain control of themselves and the dark power that gives them unlife.
**Trapped in Bone and Flesh:** The soul does not rest easy in the flesh, for grave thralls are abominations by any standard. The natural order weighs upon them, the soul always fighting to remain where it is. Duty and service give purpose, helping them to resist the pressure they experience. Once the body breaks down from injury, the soul’s hold loosens and usually slips away, though powerful souls might continue on as ghosts or something far worse.
**Fearsome Silence:** Grave thralls never draw breath and thus cannot speak. They also find subtle movements of their facial muscles to be difficult, so if they show any expression, it’s weirdly exaggerated. Some grave thralls learn to communicate using hand gestures and body movements, but most just exist in stony silence.
# Creating a Grave Thrall
You can either choose grave thrall as your ancestry for a new character, or an existing character might become a grave thrall. Either way, grave thralls begin as living creatures of flesh and blood. Humans, dwarfs, orcs, goblins, and similar creatures can become grave thralls, but clockworks and changelings cannot.
If you create a new character with the grave thrall ancestry, first create a character with another ancestry that could become a ghoul and then apply the following traits to your character, advancing the character until it has the benefits for your group level. The level 4 grave thrall expert benefits replace those you would normally gain from your original ancestry.
You might become a grave thrall between adventures if it makes sense for your character and story. You can also become a grave thrall during an adventure, especially if another character has the appropriate Necromancy spell and casts it on your corpse (see “Creating Undead” in Occult Philosophy). If you become a grave thrall, simply apply the following traits to your character.
## Attributes
