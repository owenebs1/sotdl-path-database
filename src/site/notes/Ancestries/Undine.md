The wild people under the waves, called undines, have lived in the songs and stories of sailors for many years. They are considered by many a mythical race, every tale merely one more of the yarns spun by old salts deep in their cups. Some of those stories told of helpful water spirits who would save the drowning and lead the lost to safety. Others tell of wild and fierce people who swam up from the depths to drag vessels to a watery doom or called down wind and rain to batter ships and send them off course, lost forever. Whether they see the undines as friend or foe, most people who live by the sea swear that the creatures are real, even if those folk have never seen one.
Undines, of course, do exist, along with a variety of other ocean-dwelling peoples—merrows, nereids, sirens, and so forth. Undines stand apart from the faeries and spirits of the sea in that they are elementals, a soulless race created by the genies when the world was still young, ordered to shape, nurture, and protect their creation from the demons of the Void. Although the genies have since gone mad and become scattered across the lands far and wide, the undines and other elemental peoples live on, remnants of those powerful shapers of reality and keepers of the ancient lore.
**Aloof Elementals:** After the genies ceded their mastery of the world to the faeries and the mortal races, the elementals went their separate ways, with the gnomes withdrawing underground, the salamanders to the fiery, inhospitable places, and the sylphs to high mountain peaks. The undines withdrew to the ocean depths, where they have remained for thousands of years, sometimes glimpsed but rarely encountered. Undines divorced themselves from the lesser peoples and other elementals alike, distrusting all outsiders. Now that they have begun to return to the world, they do so cautiously, finding it much changed from the way they left it.
**Returning to the World:** Only in recent times have the undines shown themselves to surface-dwellers in any great numbers. What began as a trickle, with a few envoys and traders bearing wonders from the depths, has increased over the years as undine families have begun settling in Freeport, coastal communities, and other established settlements on remote islands. Though undines are as comfortable out of the water as in it, their recent arrival and commingling seems odd to most land-dwellers, but the undines keep their reasons to themselves, leaving only speculation over what accounts for the behavior.
**Born from Water:** A tall, willowy people, undines stand about 6 feet tall and weigh up to 120 pounds. They have smooth, moist skin tinged with blue, green, or, rarely, pink, and plain features, with large, dark eyes, two small slits for nostrils, and wide mouths with generous lips. Their skin sometimes shimmers, as if it were covered in fine scales. All have webbing between their fingers and toes.
**Elementals:** Undines, like other elementals, enjoy a long life span, surviving for two centuries or longer. Since they lack souls, they live but one life, and death is always permanent for them. In fact, when undines die, their bodies turn to water and collapse into a brief, rushing flood.
**Dividers of Land:** The genies made the undines, just as they made the gnomes, the sylphs, and the salamanders, and as such, the undines had a purpose: to enrich the lands with water and promote life all over the world. It fell to them to divide the lands with oceans, to carve out the beds for rivers and lakes, and to couple with the sylphs to make the clouds that brought the life-giving rains. When madness started to afflict the genies, the undines withdrew to the seas, leaving the world they had helped create to await a time when their masters would return. Now, with the shadow of the Demon Lord darkening the world, they believe the awaited time is at hand.
**Changeable Nature:** An undine can be as calm as a still pool or as tempestuous as a hurricane, liable to switch from one mood to another with little provocation and no warning. Undines can be warm and comforting, or cold and biting. They never cling to grudges, though, and consider the end of any altercation to be the end of the problem that caused it.
**The King under the Waves:** Like other elementals, undines do not worship gods in the manner of mortals and instead serve the genies, as they were made to do so long ago. Undines serve all the genies, but they hold an affinity for those who mastered the waters of the world. One figure in particular has risen to prominence among the undines, an entity they call the King under the Waves—a name they invoke but never explain. In truth, this entity is an ancient, insane genie locked beneath a sunken city. The undines who serve this being keep their master in a state of sleep, lest he waken and bring about the apocalypse. Devotees of the King under the Waves have access to the Destruction, Storm, and Water traditions.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3     | You are cruel, vicious, and loathsome. You might hide your nature or show your wickedness to all you encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4–5   | You are wild and free, laughing all the time. Others might find your personality uplifting, even infectious, while some might find you deeply irritating, never acting serious no matter how dire the situation.                                                                                       |

| 13–15 | You feel your moods shift all the time, but you have learned to harness them and prevent them from having power over you. Others might find you intense, but you rarely lose control.                                                                                                                  |
| 16–17 | You rarely show emotion. Calm and collected, you display restraint in almost any situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 18    | You strive to do good in the world, to transform creation into something greater than the genies imagined, into a place where all worlds are free from the Void’s shadow. You show compassion for other peoples and work to understand them and their kind, so you can help them realize a better path |
