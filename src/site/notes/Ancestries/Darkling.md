| 15  | You have the legs of a frog, fox, grasshopper, or of some other animal.                                                                                                      |

| 3     | Darkness claimed you, transforming you into a monstrous thing, though it might not be evident by merely looking at you. You actively work to make the lives of people around you worse, spreading pain, terror, and despair wherever you go. You revel in the chaos and the horror you create and no act is so foul for you to consider it taboo.        |
| 4–5   | You are a diabolical monster, an immoral force for evil in the world. Fully in league with the Devil, you seek to corrupt as many mortals as you can, to ensure they fall screaming into Hell.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6–8   | Malicious and hateful, you direct your efforts toward destroying your enemies. Destruction is not enough for you, however. You want to make them suffer first. You kill pets, murder children, lead loved ones into such horror they go mad. Only when you have thoroughly broken your enemies do you relent by dragging the knife across their throats. |
| 9–12  | Your hatred bubbles just under your surface and you lash out with little provocation and often for no reason at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13–15 | You regret what you have become and see yourself as a monster. You strive to shake off Hell’s chains, but you know you are damned no matter what you do.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16–17 | You fight against the darkness in your heart and work to be an agent of good in the world. You suppress your impulses and try to make peace with those around you.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 18    | Remorse fills your heart and drives you to make amends for the horrors you have unleashed on the world. You strive for redemption, to earn back your place among the faeries, and to rid yourself of your infernal burden.                                                                                                                               |

If you kill any, more come to take the place of the fallen moments later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Your laughter sounds like crying children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3   | Your sexual organs carry a horrific disease. Any creature with whom you have sexual congress must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane or become diseased. Each time a creature diseased in this way completes a rest, it must repeat the challenge roll, receiving no benefit from completing the rest on a failure. After six successes, the creature removes the diseased affliction. |
| 4   | Your flesh is cracked and riddled with fissures that exude foul-smelling pus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | Once a year, a pregnant woman within 1 mile of you gives birth to a small monster that kills her and then goes on a rampage until it is put down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6   | A second mouth appears on your neck and whispers awful things to you while you sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | Your eyes push themselves out of your head and orbit your skull. Their new positions do not affect your vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8   | Vomit-pink mites infest your body. When you sleep, they sometimes arrange themselves to spell out the nature of your crimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 9   | You cannot hold down anything you eat. You do not need to consume food, but you still hunger for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10  | Other faeries are always hostile to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11  | You spoil any food you touch, causing it to become poisonous to any creature that consumes it. A creature that eats the food must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d3 damage and become poisoned for 1d6 hours.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12  | Whenever you kill a living creature with a soul, the body rots, forcing each creature that can see it to make a Will challenge roll. A creature becomes immune to this effect on a success, or gains 1 Insanity on a failure.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 13  | You vomit up maggots whenever you laugh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14  | Faces of people you have killed sometimes appear in fires that burn within short range of you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15  | Whenever you urinate, a centipede scuttles out from your urethra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 16  | All of your teeth are black and pointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17  | Your body hurts all the time. When you take damage, you take 1 extra damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 18  | Your bones shift and pop, rearranging themselves to make you appear weird and monstrous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 19  | The skin from your body pulls itself away leaving just muscle and bones behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 20  | An extra arm grows out from the back of your body, over which you have no control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 1   | You or your ancestors fought the trolls long ago.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2   | You had many lovers among the First People and you took up with the Betrayer after the Edene slew them all.                                                                                                         |
| 3   | The Edene captured and tortured you for years. By the time you escaped, you were horrifically scarred.                                                                                                              |
| 4   | You stole a baby from a human family and drowned it in a pool of your urine. Gain 1 Corruption.                                                                                                                     |
| 5   | You once saved the Betrayer’s life by shouting a warning. He rewarded you with an enchanted object that you still carry with you.                                                                                   |
| 6   | You keep the bodies of several smaller faeries you killed preserved in embalming fluid to prevent their souls from ever decaying. Gain 1 Corruption.                                                                |
| 7   | You frequently sought out mortal newlyweds and murdered the husband or wife on their wedding night. Gain 1 Corruption.                                                                                              |
| 8   | You spent years inflicting torments on mortals to discover new ways of making them suffer. You have left a trail of mutilated and maimed people behind wherever you go.                                             |
| 9   | You spent many years living in Hell, playing politics with the other devils to advance your position and gain power. After a misstep, you fled the place before your enemies could destroy you.                     |
| 10  | Against your better judgment, you fell in love with a mortal. When the person spurned your attentions, you killed him or her, but not before you killed everyone the mortal loved.                                  |
| 11  | Fighting the ennui that comes from years spent in isolation, you committed yourself to pleasure and have indulged in every vice you could find that would stimulate your senses.                                    |
| 12  | You traveled to Alfheim to beseech forgiveness from the Faerie Queen and to claim your place among your people. You were humiliatingly refused and cast out, and now hate other faeries as much as you hate humans. |
| 13  | You have the Devil’s favor and he sometimes watches your exploits shown on the surface of the blood he sips from his Chalice of Hate.                                                                               |

| d20   | Motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1–2   | You witnessed the destruction wrought by one or more demons at some point in the past. As demonic incursions have been increasing thanks to the shadow creeping across the land, you felt moved to set aside your grudges and take up arms against darkness more evil and more ruinous than you. |
| 3–4   | After being robbed by cultists, adventurers, or someone else, you set out to regain what is yours. You scour the lands for signs of your purloined possessions and you won’t stop until you get them back.                                                                                       |
| 5–6   | You consulted a hag who told you that dark times were coming to the world and that you would play some major part in the crisis.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 7–8   | A faerie lord or lady sought you out and recruited you to help them fight against the horrors being loosed in the world. In return, they promise to help cleanse you of your Corruption and welcome you to one of the hidden kingdoms.                                                           |
| 9–10  | A mortal, by intent or accident, learned your true name and whisked you away to serve as the mortal wishes. You are bound to that mortal for seven years and seven days and must do as ordered. Luckily, your binder sets you loose to be his or her agent.                                      |
| 11–12 | A herald of Diabolus found you and pressed you into service with other characters. You might be a spy, feeding the dark lord information about these characters, or an integral part of the team, your talents necessary for whatever great quest they undertake.                                |
| 13–14 | You spent centuries destroying lives and now, it seems, you have lost your taste for all things related to your hatred. You set out to do something different.                                                                                                                                   |
| 15–16 | You and the other characters come together to confront a mutual threat, something that poses great danger to all of you.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17–18 | Another darkling betrayed you and now you seek revenge. You join up with the other characters to get it.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19–20 | You have so much blood on your hands, so many screams in your ears, you feel as if you are sliding into madness. The only hope for you is to break your ties to the Devil and somehow find redemption in this chaotic world.                                                                     |
