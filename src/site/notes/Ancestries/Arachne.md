The arachne infest the Spider Wood, living as thralls to a powerful demon known as the Queen of Spiders. Once human, long association with and service to this vile being has infected these people with darkness, blackening their souls in return for their patron’s gifts.
Arachne despise other peoples and brook no trespassers into their lands, taking any interlopers they find as slaves, or, depending on the whims of their Queen, hauling them  to the blood-stained altars where they are sacrificed. In a very few cases, the hapless prisoners are brought before the gate of the vault where the Demon Queen is bound for direct interrogation in her continuing effort to find a way to escape her prison.
Although this supplement provides many sample characters, you can use the following rules in conjunction with those found in Shadow of the Demon Lord to create unique high-caste arachne secondary characters. If you want to create an arachne of a lower caste, use the [[Ancestries/Human\|human]] ancestry, but reduce the starting Will score to 8 and add the shadowsight trait.
You can also use these rules to let players create arachne characters, but as servants of a hideous demon, they do not often leave the Spider Wood nor do they find themselves in league with peoples who fight against the Demon Lord’s dread influence. For this reason, the arachne ancestry might not be suitable for all groups and their association with more traditional character options should be an extraordinary situation that requires some degree of explanation to make sure they are an appropriate addition to a new or existing group.
**Fear and Loathing:** Fear of the Demon Queen drives arachne hatred for outsiders as they know that displeasing their mistress means their doom. Along with that fear is a subconscious shame for what they have become, an understanding that they long ago forfeited their humanity by willingly serving such a monstrous entity. This shame fuels their anger and loathing of other peoples, which they take out on trespassers and their own lower castes.
**All Hail the Queen:** The Demon Queen has near total control of the arachne, making slaves of them all. From the depths of her vault, she listens to their thoughts and sees their dreams, guiding her priests to root out the skeptical and disloyal. Although the priests offer no explanation for choosing whom they choose for sacrifices, many suspect their goddess listens to their innermost thoughts, which leads most to bury deep their feelings until they have no room in their hearts and minds for anything but service to their dark mistress.
**Gifts of Darkness:** The first to come under the Queen of Spiders’ sway underwent grotesque transformations as their souls darkened from the wickedness they performed in her name. After a couple of generations, the stain of corruption manifested in a more uniform way. Those most loyal to the Queen discovered they could transform into man-size spiders.
Priests and warriors alike offered this gift as proof of their superiority, and worthiness that explained their higher station in arachne society. Most priests believe that while in spider form, they stand closer to their goddess and can better understand her desires. Warriors favor their spider forms when hunting for the greater mobility and its venomous fangs.
**Vile Goddess:** Monstrous, bloodthirsty, powerful, and wicked beyond mortal imagining, the Queen of Spiders does not belong to this world. She was summoned from the Void by the trolls in their jungle realm during the Hateful Wars with the faerie. Instead of serving the trolls, she slaughtered untold numbers of them, all the while spilling countless eggs of spiders of all shapes and sizes that now infest the forest.
The few trolls remaining bound their magical powers together and imprisoned the Demon Queen in a vault buried beneath a colossal ziggurat of jet-black stone.
From there, she whispers into the minds of her servants, commanding them to perform foul acts in her name that include live sacrifices, cannibalism, and worse. Devotees of the Queen of Spiders have access to the Death, Demonology, and Primal traditions.
**Breaking the Chains:** Although the Demon Queen’s grip on the arachne remains as tight as it has ever been, the people utterly in her thrall, the further the arachne travel from the Spider Wood, the weaker her hold becomes on their hearts and minds. Those who are freed from her poisonous influence find themselves questioning everything they believe to the point that a few even abandon their people altogether to find another place for themselves in the world. They might be free from their people, but their unusual appearance and odd manner makes it difficult to fit into civilized lands.
