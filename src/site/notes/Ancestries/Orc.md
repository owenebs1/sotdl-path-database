| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3–5   | You are grotesque. Your face is a mass of scar tissue. Thick scars crisscross your body, held together with crude, leather stitching. Swaths of open sores weep streams of pus, and you reek of excrement, blood, and rot. |
| 6–8   | You are monstrous, with thick, brutish features, weird growths sprouting from your skin, and nasty scars that cut jagged lines across your thick hide.                                                                     |
| 9–12  | You are ugly. You have thick tusks jutting from your broad jaw, a sloping forehead, and tiny eyes set deep in your skull.                                                                                                  |

| 16–17 | Your features are somewhat less brutish, though you might have odd skin coloration, extra fur, and thick features.                                                                                                         |
| 18    | You stand out from other orcs. Your body is remarkably free from the scars and injuries that maim your fellows, and you are in pretty good health.                                                                         |
