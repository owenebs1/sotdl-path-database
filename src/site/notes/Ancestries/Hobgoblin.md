When the fey go to war, they rely on the hobgoblins to take up arms and lead the van. Made for battle, hobgoblins are ever eager to wet their blades with the blood of their enemies. The great fey created hobgoblins from goblin stock, stripping them of their immortality. They imbued what remained with might and courage, to make them into obedient soldiers willing to die in the defense of their lands and masters.
**Same in Every Way:** Identical to one another, all hobgoblins have heavy, distended bellies that hang like fleshy skirts over their thighs, spindly limbs, and drooping facial features with heavy jowls. They all stand exactly 5 feet, 4-1/2 inches tall and weigh 166 pounds no matter how much or how little they eat. Each hobgoblin has both male and female anatomy to make breeding more efficient. Like goblins, hobgoblins are fecund, but they never live for more than thirty-three years.
**The Frenzy:** Hobgoblins lose control in a fight, becoming wild and violent killers. When they enter the state known as “the frenzy,” they behave in odd ways and undergo bizarre transformations. The change never lasts long, and when they regain control, they revert to their typical appearance and usual behavior.
**Live to Serve:** The highest ideal to which all hobgoblins strive is to acquit themselves well in service to their patrons, even if doing so means their death. Hobgoblins venerate their patrons—the Faerie Queen, the Goblin King, the Prince of Robins—almost as gods and invoke their names when they are surprised, angered, or amazed. Hobgoblins believe that their people share one soul, so death holds no fear for them so long as at least one hobgoblin lives.
**Simple Ambitions:** Hobgoblins were made to fight, but battle does not occur frequently enough to hold their attention. They spend their time between battles drinking, fighting, and mating. Many hobgoblins become quite skilled at making arms and armor, rivaling dwarfs in their crafting ability.
**Common Names:** A hobgoblin’s full name consists of three numbers. The first number is the sum of all the last numbers of one’s grandparents. The second is the sum of the last numbers of one’s parents. The third number indicates one’s order of birth within the family. So, the second (2) hobgoblin born to the fourth and fifth (4+5) hobgoblins born to the third, fifth, first, and second (3+5+1+2) hobgoblins would be named 11-9-2. Hobgoblins typically refer to each other by the last numbers of their names, and some adopt nicknames given to them by their acquaintances.

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | In a large, chaotic battle, you became separated from your unit. You wandered off and became lost in mortal lands.                                                                       |
| 2   | Accused of cowardice, you left your homeland in disgrace.                                                                                                                                |
| 3   | A spell whisked you from your homeland and bound you to serve a mortal summoner. You escaped the magical bonds when your summoner died.                                                  |
| 4   | You spent the last 1d3 years hiding in the cellar of a house owned by a human family. You often crept up to watch the family members sleep.                                              |
| 5   | A hag bound you to her service, compelling you to steal children to feed to her ovens. You escaped a few days ago, and you fear she might find you and turn you into a toad.             |
| 6   | You helped defend a faerie site from a rampaging troll and bear the scars from that encounter with pride.                                                                                |
| 7   | You were a spy for the Lord of Hell in the realms of faerie. You were discovered, but escaped before your foes could kill you.                                                           |
| 8   | You were an elf’s henchman. You despised your master.                                                                                                                                    |
| 9   | You were a member of a small military unit in the faerie realm.                                                                                                                          |
| 10  | You belonged to a company of hobgoblins pledged to defend your hidden kingdom.                                                                                                           |
| 11  | You were a sergeant in your military unit, leading your team on forays against the enemies of the hidden kingdoms.                                                                       |
| 12  | You spent your early life protecting your homeland but gave up that endeavor to explore the mortal world.                                                                                |
| 13  | You fled your homeland after you murdered an elf. You have not been able to clean the faerie’s blood from your hands.                                                                    |
| 14  | You accompanied an elf out of Alfheim to combat the growing darkness in the world. The elf might be another character in the group, or someone else from whom you have become separated. |
| 15  | Your homeland vanished, devoured by demons, and you are the sole survivor.                                                                                                               |
| 16  | You killed a human warrior in battle. You start the game with a sword.                                                                                                                   |
| 17  | You befriended a young girl and served as her protector. Now you wonder what became of her.                                                                                              |
| 18  | You lived with goblins for 1d3 years to learn more about your people’s heritage. You left disappointed with what you discovered.                                                         |
| 19  | You have mated with several hobgoblins, and you have 1d6 children that you know about.                                                                                                   |
| 20  | You spent many years as one of the Faerie Queen’s guards. You left this service after discovering some terrible secret.                                                                  |

| 8         | You drop 1d6 small bricks from your rear that land on the ground in your space the instant you become frenzied.                                                       |

# Hobgoblin Personality

| 3d6   | Personality                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | You hate everything. The only activity you like more than watching things die is being the one to kill them.                                                                           |
| 4–5   | Something is wrong with you. You lack all sense of duty and discipline, even when you’re not under the influence of the frenzy. You bristle at commands and smart off to your betters. |
| 6–8   | You are loyal to the faerie and consider mortals to be nothing more than talking animals. You tolerate them, at best.                                                                  |
| 9–12  | You live to serve. You seek out a person of authority to whom you can devote yourself. You follow orders from this person, no matter how despicable.                                   |
| 13–15 | You take responsibility for your friends, and you would die to protect them from harm.                                                                                                 |
| 16–17 | You are in love with the Faerie Queen. You know she will never reciprocate, but you hope to one day make yourself worthy in her eyes. Everything you do, you do for her.               |
| 18    | Violence sickens you. You acquit yourself in battle as needed, but when it’s over you must spend a few moments being violently sick.                                                   |
