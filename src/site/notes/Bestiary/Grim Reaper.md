**Insubstantial:** A grim reaper takes half damage from
weapons, can move through solid objects and other creatures, and ignores the effects of moving across difficult terrain.
**Spell Defense:** A grim reaper takes half damage from spells and makes any challenge roll to resist a spell with 1 boon. A creature attacking a grim reaper with a spell makes the attack roll with 1 bane.
**Revealed in Death:** A grim reaper is invisible to all creatures other than spirits and incapacitated creatures. If the grim reaper uses an action to attack, it loses this trait for 1 round.
**Eternal:** When a grim reaper becomes incapacitated, it collapses into streams of dissipating shadow. It returns to existence, 24 hours later, in the Underworld with no damage.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Scythe** (melee) +10 with 1 boon (3d6+6 plus Wreck Soul)
**Wrack Soul:** A living creature must get a success on a Will challenge roll or become impaired for 1 minute. If a creature is already impaired this way, it instead becomes defenseless for as long as it is impaired.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Mark for Death:** The grim reaper can use an action, or a triggered action on its turn, to choose one creature it can see within medium range. Until the grim reaper uses Mark for Death again, becomes incapacitated, or the target becomes incapacitated, the grim reaper makes attack rolls against the target with 2 boons and the target automatically begins dying when it becomes incapacitated.
**Swift Casting:** The grim reaper can use a triggered action at any time during the round to cast a spell it knows.
**Messenger of Death:** The grim reaper can use an action to move from the Underworld to an open space of its choice within short range of any living creature in the world, or to move from the world to any open space in the Underworld.

### END OF THE ROUND
**Shed Afflication:** A grim reaper removes all afflictions from itself.
**Death Knell:** Each living creature within short range must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 2d6 + 2 damage. A creature that takes this damage heals half damage for 1 round.
**Harvest Soul:** The grim reaper kills one dying creature within short range. During the next round, the grim reaper can take one additional action and one additional triggered action.
