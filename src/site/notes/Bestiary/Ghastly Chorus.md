**Amorphous:** A ghastly chorus can move freely through openings wide enough to permit the passage of water, and it can move through spaces occupied by other creatures.
**Dazing Horror:** Creatures that gain Insanity from the ghastly chorus’s Mournful Song are also dazed while they are frightened in this way. A creature that is already dazed is instead stunned for the duration.

**Crushing Grab** The target is grabbed. If it was already grabbed, the target instead takes 3d6 extra damage.
### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Mournful Song:** Each creature within medium range of the ghastly chorus that can hear it must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature gains 1 Insanity.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Creep:** The ghastly chorus moves up to half its speed.
