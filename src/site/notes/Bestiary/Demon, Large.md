# demonic talents
1. **Incarnation of death** The radius of the demon’s Demonic Shadows increases by 1 yard. At the end of each round, each living creature in the area that is not a demon must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage.
2. **Forment Discord** Once per round, the demon can use a triggered action on its turn to make a Will attack roll against the Will of one target creature within medium range of it. On a success, the target becomes consumed by hate for 1 round. While consumed by hate, it must take the first turn it can and use an action to charge or make an attack with a weapon against a target chosen by the demon.
3. **Demon seed** When the demon gets an attack roll total of 20 or higher with its natural weapon and exceeds the target’s Defense by 5 or more, it attempts to implant its seed in the target’s body. The target must make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the target becomes implanted with a demon seed. The seed takes 1d6 rounds to mature. At the end of each round until then, the target takes 1d6 damage and must make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the target is dazed from pain for 1 round. At the end of the round in which the seed matures, the target takes 3d6 damage and a tiny demon tears free from its body, entering an open space within 1 yard of it.
4. **Poisonous** The demon’s claws, fangs, or other natural weapons drip with venom. It gains the poisonous trait (see Customizing Creatures).
5. **Dread** The demon uses an action or a triggered action on its turn to send a wave of terror into an 8-yard-long cone originating from a point it can reach. Each creature in the area must make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the creature gains 1 Insanity. If the creature is already frightened, it also becomes stunned for 1 minute. Once the demon uses Dread, it cannot do so again for 1 hour.
6. **Weapon of chaos** The demon wields a weapon of chaos, a manifestation of its dark will, in place of its natural weapon. Attack rolls with this weapon are made with 1 boon, dealing 1d6 + its natural weapon damage. In addition, a creature that takes damage from the weapon of chaos gains 1 Corruption.
7. **Erratic** At the end of each round, roll a d6. On an odd number, the demon is dazed for 1 round. On an even number, the demon can take both a fast turn and a slow turn during the next round, making attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.
8. **Legion** The demon’s form is a fusion of several smaller demons. The first time it takes any damage, it collapses into a pile of small demons. Divide the original demon’s Difficulty by 50 to determine how many appear; each enters an open space within 1 yard of the original demon’s space and can take the next available turn. The new demons do not have this talent.
9. **Stench** At the end of each round, each living creature within short range of the demon must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes impaired for 1 round.
10. **Plague-bearer** The demon carries a loathsome disease. It gains the infectious trait (see Customizing Creatures).
11. **Barbed Tendrils** The demon uses an action to launch 1d6 barbed tendrils from its body, dividing them as it chooses between any number of target creatures within short range of it. For each tendril, the demon makes a Strength attack against the target’s Agility. On a success, the tendril punches into the target’s body, dealing 1d6 damage. Until it frees itself, the target cannot move away from the demon and is pulled along (remaining at the same distance) if the demon moves away from it. The target can free itself by destroying all the tendrils attached to it. Each tendril has Defense 5 and Health 5. Once the demon uses Barbed Tendrils, it cannot do so again for 1 hour.
12. **Pincers** When the demon gets a success on an attack roll using its natural weapon, it can use a triggered action to grab the target.
13. **Infested** Tiny animals, such as rats or frogs, infest the demon’s body. When the demon takes damage from a weapon, 1d6 tiny animals spill out of it and attack the creature that damaged their host. Each enters an open space within 1 yard of the demon’s space and can take the next available turn. Once the demon uses Infested, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds.
14. **Spiked Tail** The demon uses an action or a triggered action on its turn to make a Strength attack roll with 1 boon against the Defense of one target creature within the demon’s reach + 1. On a success, the target takes 2d6 damage.
15. **Flatulence** The demon uses an action or a triggered action on its turn to expel a foul cloud of gas from its orifices. The cloud spreads out in an 8-yard-long cone from a point the demon can reach. Each creature in the area must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes poisoned while it remains in the cloud and for 1 round after it leaves. While poisoned in this way, the creature is also dazed. Once the demon uses Flatulence, it cannot do so again for 1 hour.
