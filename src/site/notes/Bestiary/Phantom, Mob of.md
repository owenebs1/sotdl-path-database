**Difficulty 100**

**Perception** 11 (1); darksight 
**Defense** 16; **Health** 80; **Insanity** —; **Corruption** 1

**Speed** 10

**Insubstantial:** A mob of phantoms takes half damage from
weapons, can move through solid objects and other creatures, and ignores the effects of moving across difficult terrain.
**Mob:** A mob takes half damage from attacks that target individual creatures and double damage from attacks that affect an area. The mob acts as a single creature, but it counts as ten creatures for the purpose of choosing targets. A mob makes Intellect and Will challenge rolls with 1 boon.
Creatures can move through the mob’s space, but such creatures treat the area as difficult terrain. The mob can squeeze through openings large enough to permit the passage of an individual member and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures.
**Naturally Invisible:** A phantom is invisible to all creatures other than spirits, animals, and children. While invisible, the phantom lacks the horrifying trait and cannot use its attack options.
**Spawn:** When the mob becomes incapacitated, it dissipates, and 1d6 [[Bestiary/Phantom\|Phantom]]s appear in open spaces within the space it formerly occupied. They can take the next available turn.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Phantom Weapons** (melee) +3 with 4 boons (4d6+2, or 2d6+2 if injured)
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Manifestation:** The mob of phantoms uses an action, or a triggered action on its turn, to become visible. It remains visible until it uses an action, or a triggered action at any time, to become visible once more.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Overwhelm:** If the mob is not injured, each creature that isn’t a swarm or a mob that is in the mob’s space or within 1 yard of it must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage.
