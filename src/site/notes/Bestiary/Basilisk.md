**Captivating Appearance:** On first seeing a basilisk, a creature must make a Will challenge roll with 3 banes. On a failure, the creature gains 1 Insanity and cannot avert its eyes from the basilisk for 1 round. Whether it gets a success or failure, it is immune to that basilisk’s Captivating Appearance until after that creature completes a rest.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Fangs** (melee) +7 with 3 boons (4d6 plus Poison)
**Poison:** The target must make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes. It takes 4d6 damage and becomes poisoned for
1 minute on a failure, or just takes half the damage on a success. If the target is already poisoned, it instead takes 4d6 extra damage.
At the end of each round, a creature poisoned in this way must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, it takes 2d6 damage and also becomes dazed for 1 round.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Killing gaze:** Each creature within medium range of the basilisk that can see it must either use a triggered action to avert its eyes from the basilisk’s gaze or make a Strength challenge roll with 2 banes.
For 1 round, a creature that averted its eyes makes attack rolls with 2 banes and other creatures make attack rolls against it with 2 boons.
A creature that gets a failure on the Strength challenge roll takes 3d6 damage. A creature that becomes incapacitated by this damage dies instantly.
