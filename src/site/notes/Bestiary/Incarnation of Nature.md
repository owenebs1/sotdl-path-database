**Nature Stride:** An incarnation ignores the effects of moving across difficult terrain caused by plants, roots, and other forms of undergrowth.
**Fallen Giant:** When an effect would knock the incarnation prone, its body covers an area on the ground that is as tall and wide as the creature, starting at the edge of its space and extending away from the source of the effect that knocked it prone. The incarnation deals 10d6 damage to each creature and object in the area where it falls. A creature can make an Agility challenge roll with 5 banes. On a success, the creature takes just half the damage and moves to the nearest open space outside the area. On a failure, the creature becomes trapped under the incarnation.
A trapped creature is prone, blinded, immobilized, and totally covered. It can use an action to make an Agility challenge roll with 6 banes. On a success, the creature moves to the nearest open space and is no longer trapped.
**Cold and Fire Vulnerability:** An incarnation takes double damage from cold and fire.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Appendage** (melee) +9 with 2 boons (9d6 plus Grasping Vines)
**Grasping Vines:** A creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane or become immobilized. A creature can use an action to repeat the roll and removes the affliction on a success.
### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Hail of Thorns:** The incarnation launches a barrage of thorns from its body into a 20-yard-long cone. Each creature in the area must make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane. A creature takes 6d6 damage on a failure, or half the damage on a success. If a creature gets a 0 or lower, it also becomes impaired until it or another creature uses an action to remove the thorns.
**Sweeping Appendages:** The incarnation sweeps its appendages around its body to attack any creatures it chooses that it can reach. Each target must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 3 banes or take 6d6 damage.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Regeneration:** If the incarnation is not incapacitated, it heals 3d6 damage.
**Tightening Vines:** Each creature immobilized by the incarnation’s Grasping Vines takes 3d6 damage.
**World Pollen:** Clouds of sweet pollen spill from the incarnation’s body to partially obscure the area within 5 yards of it for 1 round. Any living and breathing creature in the area when the world pollen appears or that enters it must make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes. On a success, the creature becomes immune to World Pollen for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature gains 1d6 Insanity and becomes fatigued for 1 hour. While fatigued, the creature is also impaired.
