**Mob:** A mob takes half damage from attacks that target individual creatures and double damage from attacks that affect an area. The mob acts as a single creature, but it counts as ten creatures for the purpose of choosing targets. A mob makes Strength, Intellect, and Will challenge rolls with 1 boon.
Creatures can move through the mob’s space, but such creatures treat the area as difficult terrain. The mob can squeeze through openings large enough to permit the passage of an individual member and 
**Spawn:** When the mob becomes incapacitated, it dissipates, and 1d6 [medium monsters](obsidian://open?vault=Test%20bestiary&file=Core%20Rule%20Book%2FMonster%2C%20Medium) appear in open spaces within the space it formerly occupied. They can take the next available turn.

### END OF THE ROUND
**Overwhelm:** If the mob is not injured, each creature that isn’t a swarm or a mob that is in the mob’s space or within 1 yard of it must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage.
