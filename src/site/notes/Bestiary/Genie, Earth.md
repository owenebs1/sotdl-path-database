### END OF THE ROUND
**Unruly Earth:** Each creature that is not a genie on the ground within short range of the earth genie must make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane, falling prone on a failure. A creature that is already prone instead takes 2d6 damage. Objects on the ground in the area automatically take 2d6 damage.
