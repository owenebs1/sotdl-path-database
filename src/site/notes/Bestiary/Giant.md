**Crushing Footfalls:** When a giant moves into a space occupied by a creature on the ground, the creature must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, it takes 3d6 damage and falls prone. If it’s already prone, it takes 1d6 extra damage. A creature makes this roll once per round per giant regardless of how many times the giant moves through its space.
When a giant moves into a space occupied by a creature on the ground, the creature must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, it takes 3d6 damage and falls prone. If it’s already prone, it takes 1d6 extra damage. A creature makes this roll once per round per giant regardless of how many times the giant moves through its space.
**Giantfall:** The giant deals damage equal to 2d6 × its Size to everything in the area where it falls. A creature can make an Agility challenge roll with a number of banes equal to the giant’s Size (minimum 1 bane). On a success, the creature takes half the damage and moves to the nearest open space outside the area. On a failure, the creature becomes trapped under the giant’s body.
A trapped creature is prone, blinded, immobilized, and totally covered. It can use an action to make an Agility challenge roll with a number of banes equal to the giant’s Size + 1. On a success, the creature moves to the nearest open space and removes all afflictions imposed by Giantfall.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
