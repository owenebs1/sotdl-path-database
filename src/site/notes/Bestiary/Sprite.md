**Insubstantial:** A sprite takes half damage from weapons, can move through solid objects and other creatures, and ignores the effects of moving across difficult terrain.
**Spell Defense:** A sprite takes half damage from spells.
When a creature attacks the sprite with a spell, the sprite imposes 1 bane on the attack roll and makes the challenge roll to resist the attack with 1 boon.
**Iron Vulnerability:** A sprite is impaired while it is in contact with iron. As well, the sprite loses Spell Defense for as long as it remains in contact with iron and for 1 minute after.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Tiny Sword** (melee) +5 with 1 boon (1d3)
**Tiny Bow** (medium range) +5 with 1 boon (1 plus Sleep)
**Sleep:** If the target is a creature, it must get a success on a Will challenge roll or fall asleep. If the target takes damage or another creature uses an action to waken it, the target removes the affliction. Otherwise, the creature remains asleep until deprivation kills it. When the target removes this affliction, it gains 1 Insanity.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Blink:** Roll a d6. On an even number, the sprite teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within short range.
