**Split:** When an ooze takes damage from a weapon and the
damage does not incapacitate it, it divides. A second ooze moves out from the original’s space into an open space within 1 yard of it. The Size of each ooze drops by 1, and the new oozes each have Health equal to half of the original. Each ooze has half the damage total of the original ooze before it divided.
An ooze cannot divide if it is smaller than Size 1.

wide enough to permit the passage of water, and it can move through spaces occupied by other creatures.

### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Swift Attack:** When a creature within 1 yard of the ooze moves, the ooze can use a triggered action to attack the triggering creature with its pseudopod.
**Elude:** When a creature gets a failure on an attack roll against the ooze’s Defense or Agility, the ooze can use a triggered action to retreat.
