**Double Attack** You attack twice with your fist, but you must choose a different target for each attack.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Release Pollen** When you take damage, you can release a cloud of pollen from a point in your space that spreads out in a 5-yard radius. The pollen partially obscures its area and remains for 1 minute or until cleared away by wind. Each flesh and blood creature that starts its turn in the area makes a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to your use of this talent until it completes a rest. On a failure, the creature takes 3d6 damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each round, a creature poisoned in this way makes a Strength challenge roll. On a success, it ends the affliction. On a failure, it takes 3d6 damage.
Once you use this special action, you lose access to it for 1 hour.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Spreading Growth** The ground within 5 yards of you becomes covered in plant matter that counts as challenging terrain until the end of the next round.
