**Difficulty 10**

**Perception** 5 (-5); sightless 
**Defense** 8; **Health** 40; **Insanity** —; **Corruption** —

**Mob:** A mob of corpses takes half damage from attacks that target individual creatures and double damage from attacks that affect an area. The mob acts as a single creature, but it counts as ten creatures for the purpose of choosing targets. The mob makes Strength and Will challenge rolls with 1 boon.
Creatures can move through a mob’s space, but they treat the area as difficult terrain. The mob can squeeze through an opening large enough to accommodate a Size 1 creature and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures.
**Spawn:** When the mob becomes incapacitated, it dissipates, and 1d6 [[Bestiary/Animated corpse\|animated corpses]] that made up the mob appear in open spaces within the space it formerly occupied. The animated corpses can act on the next available turn.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Natural Weapon** (melee) +0 with 2 boons (3d6+1, or 1d6+1 if the mob is injured)
### END OF THE ROUND
**Overwhelm:** If the mob is not injured, each creature in its space or within 1 yard of it that is not a swarm or a mob must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take 2d6 damage.
