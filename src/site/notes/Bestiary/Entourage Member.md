**Willing Sacrifice** When you would be attacked by a creature you can see while you are within 2 yards of a member of your entourage, but before the die is rolled, the entourage member uses a triggered action to switch the target from yourself to itself.
**Summon[[ Angry Mob\| Angry Mob]]** If you are in an urban environment containing people subjected to your oratory at least once in the last seven days, you can spend 1 minute talking to such people to form into 1d3 + 1 angry mobs. The angry mobs are hostile to one or more creatures you describe to them and the mobs take the next available turn to destroy the targets of their hostility using whatever means they have. A mob might scour the town for the creatures you describe or travel up to 1 mile out of town to attack a target you choose. Once you use this talent, you must wait 24 hours before you can summon another angry mob in the same community.
