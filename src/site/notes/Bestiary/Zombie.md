**Headshot:** When the total of an attack roll with a weapon against a zombie is 20 or higher, the zombie takes damage equal to its Health instead of the weapon’s normal damage.
**Sluggish:** The zombie cannot use triggered actions. When the zombie takes a turn, it can either use an action or move up to its Speed, regardless of when it takes its turn during the round.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Teeth** (melee) +1 with 1 boon (1d6+1 plus Zombie Plague); The zombie makes the attack roll with 1 boon against a grabbed creature.
**Zombie Plague:** If the target is human or a human-like creature, it must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the target becomes diseased. While it is diseased this way, the target cannot heal damage and makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane. If it becomes incapacitated while diseased this way, it dies instantly and rises up as a new zombie 1d6 rounds later. Each time a creature diseased this way completes a rest, it must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes a 1d6 penalty to Health. The penalty lasts until this diseased affliction is removed. If this penalty reduces the creature’s Health to 0 while it is diseased this way, it dies and rises as a zombie 1d6 rounds later. After three successes, the creature removes this diseased affliction.
### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Grasping Hands:** The zombie makes a Strength attack roll with 1 boon against the Agility of one target creature within its reach. On a success, the target takes 1d3 damage and becomes grabbed.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Shuffling Advance:** The zombie moves 1d3 yards toward the nearest living creature.
