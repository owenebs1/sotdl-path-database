A mob makes Strength and Will challenge rolls with 1 boon, but makes Intellect challenge rolls with 1 bane.
**Spawn** When the mob becomes incapacitated, it dissipates and 1d6 [[Bestiary/Commoner\|commoners]] appear in open spaces within the space it formerly occupied. They can take the next available turn.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
