**Greater Horror:** Creatures make challenge rolls to resist the demon prince’s horrifying trait with 3 banes and, on a failure, gain 2d6 extra Insanity. A creature that gains Insanity from seeing a demon prince also becomes dazed for as long as it is frightened. If gained Insanity would cause a creature to go mad, the creature becomes possessed by a large demon.
**Ruinous Arrival:** When a demon prince enters the world, everything within 3d6 miles of the spot where it arrives takes 3d6 + 10 damage. A creature can make a Strength challenge roll with 3 banes and takes half the damage on a success.
In addition, each creature within range gains 2d6 Insanity and must then get a success on a Will challenge roll or gain 2d6 extra Insanity.

### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Natural Weapon** (melee) +10 with 3 boons (8d6)
### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Frenzied Attack:** The demon prince attacks two different targets with its natural weapon, making each attack roll with 1 bane.
**Demonic Roar:** The demon prince can use an action, or a triggered action on its turn, to loose a roar. Each creature that is not a demon within 1 mile of the demon prince and that can hear the roar must make a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened for 1 hour. On a success, it becomes immune to the demon prince’s roar until it completes a rest. An already frightened creature that gets a failure becomes stunned for 1 round instead.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Demonic Summons:** A demon prince can use an action to cause one [[Bestiary/Demon, Large\|large demon]], three [[Bestiary/Demon, Medium\|medium demons]], or six [[Bestiary/Demon, Small\|small demons]] to appear in open spaces the demon prince chooses within long range. Once the demon prince uses Demonic Summons, it must wait 1 hour before it can use it again.
**Void Step:** The demon prince uses an action, or a triggered action on its turn, to teleport to a space it can see within medium range. Roll a d6. On a 1, the demon prince cannot use Void Step again for 1 minute.
