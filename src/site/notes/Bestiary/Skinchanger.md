**Silver Vulnerability:** When a skinchanger takes damage from a silver weapon, it takes a penalty to Health equal to the damage. The penalty lasts until the skinchanger completes a rest.
### ATTACK OPTIONS
**Teeth** (melee; Hybrid form only) +4 with 2 boons (3d6 plus Skinchanger Curse)
**Skinchanger Curse:** If the target is human or a similar mortal creature and becomes incapacitated by the skinchanger’s attack but does not die, it must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane the next time the moon rises full. On a failure, the target transforms into a skinchanger until moonset. While transformed, it uses the skinchanger’s attributes, characteristics, attacks, talents, and traits in place of its own but can take only hybrid form. When the transformation ends, the target has no memory of its time as a skinchanger.
The curse lasts until lifted or until the target kills the skinchanger that cursed it.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Change Form:** The skinchanger uses an action or a triggered action on its turn to assume the form of a [[Bestiary/Animal, Medium\|medium animal]], assume a hybrid form, or return to its human form. While in animal form, it uses that creature’s physical attributes, characteristics, attacks, talents, and traits. It retains its own Intellect and Will. 
### END OF THE ROUND
**Regeneration:** The skinchanger heals 1d6 damage if it is not incapacitated.
