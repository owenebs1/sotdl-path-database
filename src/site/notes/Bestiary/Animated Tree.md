**Plant Camouflage:** An animated tree that is not moving looks like an ordinary plant of its kind.
**Fire Vulnerability:** An animated tree takes double damage from fire.
**Nature Stride:** An animated tree ignores the effects of moving across difficult terrain caused by plants, roots, and other forms of undergrowth.
**Tree Fall:** When an effect would knock the animated tree prone, its body covers an area on the ground that is as tall and wide as the creature, starting at the edge of its space and extending away from the source of the effect that knocked it prone. The tree deals damage equal to 2d6 x its Size to each creature or object in the area where it falls. A creature can make an Agility challenge roll with a number of banes equal to the tree’s Size. On a success, the creature takes just half the damage and moves to the nearest open space outside the area. On a failure, the creature becomes trapped under the tree.
A trapped creature is prone, blinded, immobilized, and totally covered. It can use an action to make an Agility challenge roll with a number of banes equal to the tree’s Size + 1. On a success, the creature moves to the nearest open space and is no longer trapped.
### ATTACK OPTIONS

### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Sweeping Branches:** The animated tree chooses up to four creatures it can reach. Each target must get a success on an Agility challenge roll with 2 banes or take 4d6 damage and fall prone.
