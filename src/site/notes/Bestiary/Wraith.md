**Lasting Harm:** A living target takes a cumulative penalty to Health equal to the damage taken from the attack. If the target creature becomes incapacitated by an attack a wraith makes while the target has this penalty, it dies. At the end of the next round, a new wraith with half the Health of its creator wriggles free from the body and stands up in the nearest open space. The wraith is compelled for 1 hour by its creator, after which time it can act normally.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Ethereal Wind:** The wraith uses an action or a triggered action on its turn to move up to its Speed. This movement does not trigger free attacks.
### END OF THE ROUND
**Burned by Sunlight:** The wraith takes 3d6 damage if it is in an area lit by sunlight.
