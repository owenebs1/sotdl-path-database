### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Thorny Vine:** A vine rises from the ground and attacks one target creature within medium range of the spriggan. The target must make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, it takes 1d6 damage and becomes immobilized until the spriggan dies. If the target is already immobilized, it instead takes 2d6 extra damage.
A creature immobilized this way can use an action to make a Strength challenge roll. A success ends the affliction.
### SPECIAL ACTIONS
**Camouflage:** If the spriggan is covered or in an area obscured by foliage or natural terrain features and is not being observed, it can use an action or a triggered action on its turn to automatically become hidden.
