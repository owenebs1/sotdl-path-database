Cryomancers harness the power of Water magic. They use special techniques to shape water into ice and snow through the spells they learn, and they are imbued with a special tolerance against frigid environments. Like hydromancers, cryomancers bond with genies and derive their knowledge and magical might through that connection. The cryomancer’s techniques originated in the Blötland, though nowadays practitioners can be found anywhere in cold, icy climes.
