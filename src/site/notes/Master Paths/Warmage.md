Almost all traditions of magic offer some offensive capabilities, and for good reason: enemies abound in the lands of RÃ»l. Warmages, as suggested by their name, focus on excelling in battle and using their magic for destructive ends, learning techniques to defend themselves and blast their foes. Most warmages prefer big, noisy spells to smaller, targeted effects.
