Found almost exclusively among the ranks of the New God’s followers, theurges claim a direct line to their deity, invoking power from their patron to fight against the Demon Lord and its horrid servants. Most theurges occupy positions of great honor and reverence in their religions, though the Inquisition deems the few renegade theurges at large to be as dangerous as the Demon Lord’s disciples for the heretical positions they hold, foremost of which is a denial that the New God exists at all.
