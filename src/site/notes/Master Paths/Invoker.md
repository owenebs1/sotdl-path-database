The invoker lays bare the secrets of Invocation magic, learning how to command the daemons she binds with great efficiency and effect. Having grown accustomed to the mental trauma that comes from from invoking daemons, the invoker can deepen her knowledge of the tradition without fear of going mad. In time, invokers can break all the rules for binding daemons, enabling them to adapt to almost any situation.
