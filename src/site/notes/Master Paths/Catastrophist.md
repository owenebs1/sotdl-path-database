Your unfettered, reckless approach to mastering magic rewards you with wildly destructive capabilities that more often than not slip from your control and have disastrous consequences. That bystanders, friends, and innocents alike might suffer from your use of magic has not moved you yet; you will pay any price to become the mightiest person on Urth. You have become a living conduit for magical forces and you let it pass through you to remove any and all obstacles from your path.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +3, Power +1
**Magic** You discover one tradition or you learn one spell.
**Catastrophic Magic** Whenever you use an action to cast a spell, but before you resolve the spell’s effect, you can choose to seize into catastrophic energies to enhance the spell you cast. Roll a d6. If the number rolled is a 1 or more than half your level, roll another d6 and add it to the number rolled. Find the total on the following table.

| Total | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 2     | A Void breach occurs centered on a point you can reach (see Hunger in the Void, page 5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3     | Roll 1d6 + 3. In a number of 1-yard squares on the ground within medium range equal to the total of the roll there appear noxious slicks of black tar that remain for 1 minute or until they give birth, which causes the tar to disappear.<br>Any creature in a space where the tar appears or that moves into it becomes immobilized until the tar gives birth or the creature uses an action to pull free of the tar. At the end of each round, the GM chooses one patch of tar to give birth and rolls a d6. On a 1–3, the tar gives birth to a small monster; 4–5, a medium monster; 6, a large monster. A monster born from a patch stands up and then takes the next available turn. The monster has the horrifying trait and is hostile to all creatures. |
| 4     | Wriggling black lines appear in the air around you out to short range and remain for 2d6 rounds. The presence of these lines causes creatures other than you that are in the area to become impaired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5     | Roll a d6. A number of randomly determined creatures other than you within medium range equal to the number rolled gain 1d6 Insanity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6     | The ground within 1d6 + 2 yards of you buckles and heaves to become difficult terrain. Any creature on the affected ground must succeed on an Agility challenge roll or fall prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 7     | One randomly determined creature within medium range takes 3d6 damage. If the creature becomes incapacitated, it explodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8     | A wave of kinetic energy spreads out from you in all directions out to 1d6 + 2 yards and then dissipates. The wave deals 10 damage to objects in its path. Each creature in its path must succeed on a Strength challenge roll or take 2d6 + 3 damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9     | Each object that is neither worn nor carried within medium range takes 3d6 damage. Objects destroyed in this way crumble to dust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10    | Roll 3d6 and a d20. If the total of the 3d6 roll is higher than the d20 roll, each creature within short range of you takes the higher number rolled as damage. A creature incapacitated by this damage dies, as its body turns itself inside out.<br>Otherwise, you gain d3 Insanity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11    | The ground within 5 yards of you drops 3d20 yards to leave you standing on a slender pillar of stone. Anything on the affected ground falls and takes damage on landing unless it has the flier trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12    | You take 6d6 damage and each creature and object within medium range takes twice as much damage as you do.
