Teleportation magic makes possible instantaneous transit from one place to another and achieves this by locating and exploiting soft spots in reality. The casters known as phaseshifters specialize in techniques that let them shift their bodies partly into these soft spots and thus become insubstantial. While in this state, they can pass through solid objects and other creatures.
