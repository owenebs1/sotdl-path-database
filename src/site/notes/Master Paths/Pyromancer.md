With unmatched power over elemental fire, pyromancers create and shape flames to serve their will. Most pyromancers grow their power by developing a stronger connection to the flame genies they have bound. The strength of this bond causes pyromancers to display its influence in the blaze of their eyes, the heat of their skin, and the cinders that fly from their bodies whenever they are struck by weapons.
