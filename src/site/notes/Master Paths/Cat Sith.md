Cat sith are people who have been touched by faerie magic, gained from a bargain with one of the great fey, that grants them the ability to adopt the forms of great black cats. Many cat sith are witches, though they also come from the ranks of druids, rangers, and anyone else who lives in or near the realms of the faerie. Most common folk consider black cats to be ill-omened creatures, and they stave off the bad fortune such creatures bring by leaving offerings of cream on their doorsteps.
