Many forms of magic enhance their usersâ€™ combat capabilities, but the Battle tradition was developed especially to transform spellcasters into competent warriors. Most who discover the tradition rely on its spells for their entire careers, and their combat prowess can eventually rival those who have spent their lives mastering weapons and armor. Mageblades pursue a specialized form of Battle magic that lets them fashion weapons from solidified magical energy. Armed with these gleaming blades, they can carve a path through their foes and never fear being caught unprepared.
