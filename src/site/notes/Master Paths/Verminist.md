A foul hag cursed you, turning your blood to maggots. The curse torments you for you can feel these vermin wriggle under your skin, feeding on your meat, always moving, always eating. You might have ended it all, but you learned to give yourself some measure of relief by releasing the vermin inside you into clouds of biting, stinging insects.

**Characteristics** Health +6
**Bleed Maggots** When you become injured, maggots spill out from your wounds, crawling all over your body, spilling onto the floor, and spreading out into a 3-yard radius centered on a point in your space. The maggots remain for 1d6 rounds before they die of loneliness. Any creature on the ground in the affected area when the maggots appear or that enters it must make a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane, taking 2d6 damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.
**Maggot Spray** You can use an action and take 2d6 damage to vomit a stream of biting maggots at one creature within 3 yards of you. The spray deals 5d6 damage and the target can make an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane, taking half the damage on a success. Once you use Maggot Spray, you must wait 6 rounds before you can use it again.
