Making a career out of slaying what some would argue to be the world’s most dangerous monsters is, by anyone’s standards, insane. Dragons and their lesser kin prove themselves devious opponents, armored in thick scales and armed with fiery breath, sword-length teeth, and talons capable of flensing flesh from bone. Yet a few brave or foolish men and women see not an impossible task in slaying dragons, but one that comes with wealth, fame, and glory.
A hardened lot of experienced killers, dragonslayers throw themselves into the business of ridding the world of these monsters, learning all they can to get whatever advantage they can so they can do the grisly work and walk away with their lives intact.
They develop fighting techniques that let them use their small size to great effect and to frustrate their opponents’ attacks. By the time they complete their Training, they have all the tools they need to combat these monsters for as long as their luck holds out.
