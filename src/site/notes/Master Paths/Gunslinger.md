Gunslingers know everything there is to know about firearms. Excellent shots and cunning gunsmiths, they tinker with these weapons, modifying them to improve their accuracy and to reduce the time needed to reload them. Gunslingers come from all paths, though they typically have some background in engineering, artifice, or another technical profession.
