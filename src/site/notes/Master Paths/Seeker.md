Psychic abilities are uncommon in the lands of Rûl, but those who have such gifts are tireless in finding ways to use them. Seekers are likely to have awakened their abilities during the stress of combat. Upon shedding the shackles restraining the mind, seekers use their mental powers to augment attacks, to ignore the chaos of battle, and to find the best place to strike enemies. In fact, the term seeker comes from the ability to use the third eye to seek weaknesses to exploit.
The seekers’ methods are a recent innovation, born in secluded sanctuaries for those seeking enlightenment and freedom from the darkness that drowns the world. Anyone might pursue this path, but it suits either those who have combat training or who already possess a quickened mind.
Mastering seeker techniques involves harnessing the mind’s focus to attack with incredible accuracy.
