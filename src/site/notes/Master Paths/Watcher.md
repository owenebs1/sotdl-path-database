The spellcasters known as watchers see countless possibilities before them and can divine the outcomes of their actions before they occur. They derive this ability from their gift of foresight, which might be a natural characteristic or something they developed through study. In either case, a watcher can adjust his or her tactics based on what the future holds.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Divination tradition or you learn one Divination spell.
**Gift of Foretelling** You can see events before they occur.
When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use a triggered action to force the creature to make the roll a second time. You then choose the result it uses.
Once you use this talent, you must wait 1 round before you can use it again.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Anticipate Outcomes** Your Gift of Foretelling improves.
When you would use an action, you can use two actions.
Resolve each action, one after the other, but do not apply the results of any roll you make. Once you have used both actions, choose one of them as the one that actually happened and then apply any results from using the action in the chosen way.
For example, say you take a fast turn and decide to use this talent on that turn. For one of your actions, you decide to cast an attack spell that requires you to make an attack roll. For your other action, you decide to retreat. You make the attack roll and get a success on the roll. You must then choose between expending the casting and taking the result of the roll or using your action to retreat.
You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Power score. Once you use this talent, you must wait 1 minute before you can use it again. You regain expended uses when you complete a rest.
