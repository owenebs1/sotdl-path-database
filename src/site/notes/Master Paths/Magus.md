Members of a secret cabal of magic-users, the magi identify their membership by the magical staffs they carry. The order traces its origins to the founding of the Tower Arcane, drifting through the sky above the Empire’s capital, when members broke from the august assembly to forge their own paths in the world. Potential candidates to join the magi must demonstrate their magical knowledge by presenting an argument about the theory of magic, display their ability to cast a spell, and, most important, complete the construction of a magical staff.
