Machinists use their knowledge of engineering and their mastery of Technomancy magic to create servants made from cogs and springs. These automatons prove more reliable and capable than other constructs, enhanced as they are by the magic flowing through their bodies.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Technomancy tradition or you learn one Technomancy spell.
**Automatons** You create three [[Bestiary/Construct, Small\|small constructs]]. You control these creatures, deciding when they take their turns and what they do on each of their turns. While these automatons are within short range of you, you grant them 1 boon on attack rolls they make. If an automaton becomes incapacitated, it is destroyed. You can replace lost automatons when you complete a rest.
**Hasty Upgrade** When one of your automatons within short range of you gets a success on an attack roll to attack with its appendage, you can use a triggered action and expend the casting of a Technomancy spell to cause the attack to deal extra damage equal to 1d6 plus 1d6 per rank of the spell.
# Level 10
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Greater Automatons** Your three automatons become [[Bestiary/Construct, Medium\|medium constructs]], each with a +2 bonus to Defense and a +10 bonus to its Health. In addition, each makes attack rolls with 1 boon.
