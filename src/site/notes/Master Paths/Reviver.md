Masters of healing, revivers are on the front lines of the fight against death from whatever cause. Like those who choose the path of the healer, they commit themselves to easing suffering and tending to the wounds of others—but where healers focus on living patients, revivers learn to use their art on those that are already dead, thus bringing life to the lifeless and eradicating abominations of undeath.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Life tradition or you learn one Life spell.
**Eradicate Death** You can use an action and expend the casting of a rank 1 or higher Life spell to release a pulse of pure energy that extends out a number of yards equal to your Power score from a point in your space and then dissipates. For each rank of the spell whose casting you expended, roll 1d6. Each living creature in the area heals damage equal to the total of your roll.
Also, each spirit and undead in the area must make a Will challenge roll. The creature takes the total of your roll as damage on a failure, or takes half the damage on a success. Once you use this talent, you must wait 1 minute before you can use it again.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Death to Life** You can use an action to touch one dead creature, spirit, or undead you can reach. If the target is unwilling, you must get a success on a Will attack roll against the target’s Agility to touch it. If you touch a dead creature, it returns to life and heals 1 damage. If you touch a spirit or an undead, it takes 2d6 damage per point of your Power score. If this damage causes a spirit to become incapacitated, it dissipates and descends to the Underworld or Hell. If this damage causes an undead to become incapacitated, one of two things happens. If the undead lacks a soul, its body is utterly destroyed. If the undead has a soul, you restore the creature to life and it heals 1 damage.
Once you use this talent, you must complete a rest before you can use it again.
