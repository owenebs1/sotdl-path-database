As a devoted follower of Shavra, goddess of the nagas, you worked your way up through the hierarchy until she chose to reveal the ultimate secrets of the faith. As a Servant of Shavra, you act on the deity’s behalf to protect the nagas and their communities from harm. When you use magic associated with your goddess, a spectral serpent sometimes forms in the air over your head.
To choose the Servant of Shavra path, you must be a devoted follower of the goddess. Normally, she counts only nagas among her followers, but you might worship this deity and be from another ancestry, with good reason.
