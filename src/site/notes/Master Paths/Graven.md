Among those who have discovered the Rune tradition are spellcasters who call themselves the graven, for they illustrate their bodies with the characters of their magical alphabet. Gaining this adornment is a painstaking and painful process, and few have the endurance to undergo the experience. Those who do, though, find that they can bring forth the magic of their tradition and other spells as well more quickly.
Each time a graven casts a spell, the symbols on his or her skin flash with faint light.
