Using Air spells to lift themselves off the ground, skydancers move with incredible speed and grace, able to swoop, climb, dive, and perform other aerial stunts.
Skydancers specialize in a fighting technique devised by the sylphs that gives them a decided advantage in aerial combat. The combination of magic with this fighting style makes them formidable adversaries whenever they take to the air.
