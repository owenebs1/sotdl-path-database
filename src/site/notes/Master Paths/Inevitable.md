Order magic opposes the chaos in the world, and its users find themselves drawn to conflicts against creatures and situations that would create uncertainty.
Such is their determination that they commit their entire lives to promoting stability and stamping out agents of anarchy and change. These champions of law take the fight to anyone who would threaten the world order, whether those individuals are agitators fighting against tyranny or wild faeries tormenting innocents on the frontier.
