Alchemy magic can produce wonders beyond imagining, including vile toxins, remedies for nearly any ailment, and can even bestow immortality. Much of this tradition deals with physical matters, but dualists, a rare breed among alchemists, use the art to attend to affairs of the soul. Dualists use chemicals augmented by magic to alter the nature of their souls, thereby awakening a new identity within themselves. This new identity is the opposite of the dualist’s normal nature—and whenever it takes control, the dualist’s body transforms to become larger, stronger, and more monstrous.
