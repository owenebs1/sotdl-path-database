Mindwitches use Telepathy magic to invade the thoughts of other creatures so they can manipulate their victims. Once their hooks are in, mindwitches can make creatures believe things that aren’t true, experience things that aren’t happening, and act in ways contrary to their nature. Although many mindwitches use their talents for good ends, many find the opportunity for skulduggery too enticing to pass up.
