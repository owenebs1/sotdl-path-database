The Life tradition offers spells that enable healing and curing. Thus, the tradition is sought by those who wish to bring aid and comfort to those in need. Healers commit themselves to tending othersâ€™ hurts, to the exclusion of other pursuits, and typically come from a background dedicated to helping others. Such is their power that when they walk through a room, wounds close, diseases vanish, and poisons become harmless.
