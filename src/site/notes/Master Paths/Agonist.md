Pain serves a purpose. It warns the individual of imminent harm and impels them to avoid continued exposure or to take steps to repair harm already sustained. For you, however, pain excites.
It titillates you. It gives you strength and feeds your passion. Something in you has gone wrong and this basic mechanism of self-preservation has become perverted, so now you delight and derive power in the mutilation of your flesh.
