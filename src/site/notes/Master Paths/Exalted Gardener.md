The World Mother made the mortal world a garden and nothing grieves her more than to watch as her creation becomes poisoned, burned, ruined. When angered, she gives of herself a gift to a being living in the world, giving them the tools they need to heal the land and punish those responsible for its injury. Exalted gardeners become extensions of the goddess’s will and their wrath reaches the heights of the divine.

**Languages and Professions** You speak one additional language of your choice.
**Magic** You discover the Nature tradition or you learn one spell from the Nature tradition.
**Plant the Seed** You can use this talent whenever you get a success on an attack roll for a weapon attack you make against a flesh and blood target that is not already under the effects of this talent. The target makes a Strength challenge roll. On a success, the target becomes immune to your use of this talent for 1 hour. On a failure, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of the round, each target poisoned in this way makes a Strength challenge roll. On a success, the target notes the result and, after three successes, the effect ends and the target becomes immune to your use of this talent for 24 hours. On a failure, the target gains 1 stage from those presented below and suffers the effects.
- **Stage 1** The target gains a +3 bonus to Defense, but takes a –6 penalty to Speed, and becomes slowed.
	These effects persist until the affliction ends or the target dies.

- **Stage 3** As stage 2, but the target drops to 0 Health and a plant bursts out of its body.
