The Great Mother, that monstrous god, chose you to be her exalted servant. Her deep, rumbling voice echoes in your mind, and you feel yourself buckling under the weight of her influence. Yet, somehow, you manage to withstand her attentions and carry out her instructions. Other molekin fear you, as they see in you the aspect of their terrible mother.

Target one cube of space, up to 5 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. Ghostly, squirming forms appear on all surfaces in that space and remain for 1 minute, covering the ground in difficult terrain and ectoplasmic vapors partially obscure the area. In addition, when you use this talent, the spirits give voice to their suffering. Each creature in that space makes a Will challenge roll with 1 bane.

**Gnashing of Teeth** You can use an action to cause rodent-like faces to appear over all surfaces inside a cube of space, 5 yards on a side, originating from a point within medium range. The faces snap and bite at all creatures in the area. A creature takes 1d6 damage and makes an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature takes 3d6 extra damage and becomes immobilized until the end of your next turn. Once you use this talent, you lose access to it for 1 hour.
**Hunger of the Great Mother** You can use an action to afflict any number of creatures you choose within short range with appalling, unnatural hunger. Each target makes a Will challenge roll with 1 bane. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the target becomes cursed by this effect for 1 minute. Until the curse ends, the target makes attack rolls with 2 boons and deals an extra 2d6 damage on all attacks it makes. If the target starts its turn with an incapacitated or dead creature in reach, the target must make a Will challenge roll with 2 banes. On a failure, the target must drop prone and use its action to feed on the incapacitated or dead creature until the start of its next turn. While feeding, the target counts as being defenseless. Once you use this talent, you lose access to it until after you rest.
