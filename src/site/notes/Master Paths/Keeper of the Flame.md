The fey were the first to bind genies in an effort to harness their power. That act earned them the enmity of those ancient spiritsâ€”a resentment that endures to this day. From their efforts, the faeries learned advanced techniques for controlling the elements, many of which have been disseminated to other peoples allover the world.
The Keepers of the Flame, in contrast, guard their secrets and remain an insular society, suspicious of outsiders and reluctant to welcome new blood into their ranks. While almost all Keepers are faerie, a talented mortal might gain entry to their ranks.
