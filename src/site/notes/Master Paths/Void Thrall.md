Slaves to the Void and to the demonic forces that gather there, Void thralls have surrendered themselves to the Demon Lord and become its willing agents of destruction in the world. Such service exacts a terrible price, and their allegiance is apparent from the wreckage of their bodies. Most Void thralls display ghastly, open wounds that reek of the sewer, and others have ridges in their flesh that show disturbing images. Their eyes nothing more than black sockets, their mouths leaking foul black ichor, Void thralls are abominations. And yet, the cost of doing business with the Demon Lord is sometimes worth this distress, even if it ultimately means their destruction, for the Demon Lord is never stingy with gifts for its avowed servants.
