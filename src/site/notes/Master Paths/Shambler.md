Some students of Nature magic find themselves altered by the tradition, their essential nature shifting more and more into something akin to a plant. Those embracing this transformation can push themselves into a different, monstrous form, becoming a hulking thing of vegetable matterâ€”leaves, vines, slime, and blooming flowers. In this form, they become mighty destroyers, able to channel the fury of nature through their every strike.
