Some students of Nature magic find themselves altered by the tradition, their essential nature shifting more and more into something akin to a plant. Those embracing this transformation can push themselves into a different, monstrous form, becoming a hulking thing of vegetable matter—leaves, vines, slime, and blooming flowers. In this form, they become mighty destroyers, able to channel the fury of nature through their every strike.

**Release Pollen** When you take damage, you can release a cloud of pollen from a point in your space that spreads out in a 5-yard radius. The pollen partially obscures its area and remains for 1 minute or until cleared away by wind. Each flesh and blood creature that starts its turn in the area makes a Strength challenge roll with 1 bane.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to your use of this talent until it completes a rest. On a failure, the creature takes 3d6 damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each round, a creature poisoned in this way makes a Strength challenge roll. On a success, it ends the affliction. On a failure, it takes 3d6 damage.
