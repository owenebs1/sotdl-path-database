The morphs constitute a strange society of spellcasters who have focused on Transformation magic. These casters typically find themselves unable to stay in one form for long and exult in the process of transformation. Such extensive use of their magic takes a toll, causing them to shed many of their distinctive characteristics or to randomly gain new ones. Many spellcasters see in the morph a cautionary tale, warning against using magic too much on oneself, but to the morph, their flexibility in form is the culmination of their efforts to master their favored tradition.
