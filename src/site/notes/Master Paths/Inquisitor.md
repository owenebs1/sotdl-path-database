Nearly all inquisitors serve the cult of the New God, working to expose corruption in the religion’s ranks and to flush out the demon-sworn, the damned, and the wicked. Key to their work is the ability to ferret out the truth. Not only do they know when people lie to them, but they also know numerous torture techniques to get their victims to reveal all their secrets.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession.
**Dreadful Threat** You can use an action to deliver a terrible threat to one target creature that is subject to your Scrutiny talent and is within short range. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, the target becomes frightened while it can see you. The effect ends when the target deals damage to you or after it completes a rest.
**Master Torturer** You can use an action to start torturing one defenseless or physically restrained creature within your reach. If you concentrate for at least 1 hour, during which time you use torturer’s tools on the target, you make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, you can ask the target 1d6 questions (the GM rolls and keeps the number a secret), and the target must answer you truthfully and to the best of its knowledge. If it doesn’t know the answer, it makes up something that you might want to hear, though it’s up to you to interpret what it says as truth or not. On a failure, the target becomes immune to this talent until it completes a rest.
**Scrutiny** You can use an action to study one creature you can see within medium range. Make a Perception attack roll against the target’s Intellect. On a success, the target is subject to your scrutiny until it completes a rest, until you can no longer see it, or until you use this talent again. On a failure, the target becomes immune to your use of this talent until it completes a rest.
While a creature is subject to your scrutiny, you know whenever it deliberately speaks a lie, and when you attack it, you make the attack roll with 1 boon.
