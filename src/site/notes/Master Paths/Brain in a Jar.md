You have long held that the body, the puppet of meat and bone and fluids, serves only to limit what you can do. Like an anchor, it weighs you down and prevents you from attaining your true potential. After months, perhaps years, spent researching strange techniques to separate your mind from your flesh, to let you tap into energies racing through your brain and use them for whatever fell purpose drives you, you finally came to a serviceable solution. So, you commanded your servants to crack open your skull, extract your brain and its stem from the wreckage of your flesh, and install the liberated organ in a chemical cocktail of nutrients contained inside a glass and steel vessel. Some had doubts, but you awoke in your new configuration, more powerful than ever.

**Disembodied Brain** You shed your original body and now exist as a disembodied brain floating in a stew of nutrients held in a glass and steel container.
