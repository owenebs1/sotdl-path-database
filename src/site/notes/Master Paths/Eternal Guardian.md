The eternal guardians are an elite order of faerie warriors established long ago to protect the magicians in the wars against the hated trolls. Eternal guardians have both magical and martial training, making them quite effective at shielding their charges from harm. Although the wars against the trolls are long over, the order persists, and nowadays its members protect the great fey and members of their courts from harm.
