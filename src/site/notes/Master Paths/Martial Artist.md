Martial artists train to master unarmed combat, fighting with their hands and feet instead of a sword or gun. Quick and strong, martial artists move with great fluidity and land strikes with a deadly precision that sends their enemies reeling.
Martial artists learn their techniques from masters, fighting schools, or in the fighting pits of a city’s seediest districts.

# Martial Arts Talents
**Dodge Missiles** When a creature attacks you with a ranged weapon, you can use a triggered action to impose 1d3 banes on the attack roll. If the total of the creature’s attack roll is 0 or less, the attack used a thrown weapon or a weapon that does not use bullets, and the weapon is your Size or smaller, you catch the missile. You can then throw it at a creature within medium range of you.
If you do, make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the target’s Defense as if attacking with a weapon. On a success, the target takes damage as if you had used an unarmed strike.
**Drunken Fighting** When you take damage from an attack made by a creature within your reach, you can use a triggered action to fall prone and halve the damage you take. The next time you attack the triggering creature before the end of the next round, you make your attack roll with 2 boons.
**Flying Kick** You can use an action to choose one creature or object within a number of yards of you equal to your Speed. You move up to your Speed toward the target, ignoring difficult terrain. When the target is within your reach, you make an attack roll with an unarmed strike against it, dealing 1d6 extra damage on a success.
**Ground Fighting** When you get a success on an attack roll to grab a creature of your Size or smaller, you can use a triggered action to fall prone and force the grabbed creature to do the same. While grabbed and prone in this way, the creature cannot stand up and makes Agility attack rolls to escape the grab with 3 banes. If the total of such an attack roll is 0 or less, the creature takes 1d6 damage.
**Killing Palm** When you damage a living creature with your unarmed strike, you can use a triggered action to use this talent. If you do, at the end of each round for 1 minute, the creature must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or take 1d6 damage. Each time it fails this roll, the creature makes the next such Strength challenge roll with 1 bane.
Once you use this talent, you can use it again only after you complete a rest.
**Roundhouse Kick** When you attack with an unarmed strike, you can make a roundhouse kick. If you do, choose two creatures within your reach. Make one attack roll with 1 bane, using the total to determine whether you hit either target.
**Staggering Strike** When the total of your attack roll with an unarmed strike is 20 or higher and exceeds the target’s Defense by 5 or more, you move the target up to 5 yards away from you. Before the end of the round, attack rolls against the target are made with 1 boon.
**Stunning Strike** When you get a success on an attack roll with your unarmed strike, you can deal half damage and force the target to make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the target becomes stunned for 1 round.
You can use this talent three times. When you complete a rest, you replenish these uses.
**Throw** When you get a success on an attack roll to grab a creature of your Size or smaller, you can use a triggered action to throw the target. Make a Strength attack roll against the target’s Strength. On a success, the target flies 1d6 yards away from you, falls prone, and takes 1d6 extra damage.
**Whirlwind of Strikes** When you use your action to use this talent, each creature you choose within 1 yard of you makes an Agility challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, a target takes 2d6 damage and you can move it 1 yard away from you.
