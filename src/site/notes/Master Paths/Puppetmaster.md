Enchantment magic enables its casters to manipulate the behavior of their enemies. Whether their spells twist emotions or make people unwitting thralls to their charms, such spellcasters excel at making others do what they want. Puppetmasters develop techniques to maneuver the creatures they have charmed to places where they can be most useful and can even exert full control over their victims when the situation demands it.
