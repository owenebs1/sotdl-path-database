Skalds preserve the lore of their people in tale and poem. Most began their training by learning the old stories, committing them to memory and recounting them to inspire their listeners. Others bind themselves to new heroes, chronicling their exploits as they unfold and immortalizing them in their epics. No simple entertainers, skalds are historians, advisors, seasoned warriors, and leaders in battle. Skalds are common among the jotun and can be found among dwarfs and humans, too.
