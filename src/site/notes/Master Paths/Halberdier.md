Before the orc uprising, the emperor relied for protection on an elite cadre of soldiers armed with halberds. It is their distinctive fighting style that other halberdiers emulate, one that exploits the long weaponâ€™s assets to great effect. Although most who come to this path prefer halberds, the techniques can apply to any kind of polearm or staff.
