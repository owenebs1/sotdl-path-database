Only those who forge bonds with earth genies can wield the power of Earth magic. Geomancers go a step farther, bridging the distance between themselves and their companion to gain even greater control over earth and stone. Such a connection escalates the physical transformation resulting from their bond; geomancers lose all their body hair, and their skin assumes the appearance of stone, whether smooth or pebbled, unbroken or fissured.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You discover the Earth tradition or learn one Earth spell.
**Earthen Defense** You can use an action to expend a casting of an Earth spell of rank 1 or higher. Roll a d6 for each rank of the spell and total the numbers rolled. The total becomes your Earthen Defense, a pool of points used to absorb damage. While your Earthen Defense pool has at least 1 point, when you take damage, subtract the damage from the pool first and then take any damage that remains. The effect lasts until the pool drops to 0 points, you use this talent again, or you complete a rest.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Earth Walker** You ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain made from earth, sand, or stone.
In addition, you can move through spaces occupied by earth, sand, or stone. If you end your movement inside a solid space, you are moved back to an open space nearest to the point where you entered that space.
