When an immortal creature of faerie dies a violent death from unnatural causes, the morrigans spring forth to avenge that death. Morrigans are physical manifestations of grief and hatred, feared for their fury and brutality. Known by the crows that keep their company, morrigans are living omens of doom, their mere presence capable of striking fear in the hearts of their enemies.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1 each
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a faerie profession.
**Crows** You have the service of two crows (each as a [[Bestiary/Animal, Tiny#^99e53a\|tiny animal]] with the Flier trait). These creatures are under your control, and they obey your spoken commands. If a crow dies, a new one replaces the old when you complete a rest.
**Doom** You can use an action to force one creature within short range that can see and hear you to make a Will challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes doomed for 1 minute.
While doomed, the creature is frightened. Also, if at least one of your crows is within 1 yard of the creature, your attacks against the creature deal 1d6 extra damage. Finally, whenever the creature gets 0 or lower as the result of an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can use a triggered action to move up to your Speed and attack it.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Murder of Crows** When you move, you can transform into a swarm of shrieking, cawing crows and remain in that form until you stop moving. In this form, you can fly, you take half damage from any attack that targets a single creature, and you can move through a space occupied by any creature, though you cannot end your move in such a space.
