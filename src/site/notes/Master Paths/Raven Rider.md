For a people able to soar among the clouds, riding beasts, even beasts that can fly, might seem strange. Yet sylphs have been breeding giant ravens to serve as companions and steeds for ages, and the raven riders stand among the greatest warriors in sylph society. Rather than conveniences, ravens become fighting partners. They have keen eyesight, can fly faster than sylphs can, and can help protect their riders while the riders do the same for them.
