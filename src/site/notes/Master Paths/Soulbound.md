Even as powerful as spellcasters can be, death still awaits even the mightiest of them. Most accept their fate, as worrisome as it might be, but some opt to thwart death by making themselves proof against Father Death’s touch. These spellcasters devise a way to anchor their souls to a physical object in the world so that if their body dies, their spirits remain in the world long enough for them to rebuild their bodies once more.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover a tradition or you learn one spell.
**Anchored Soul** If you are mortal, you acquire and bind your soul to a valuable object. The object is Size 1/8, has Health 20, and is worth 100 gc. If your body dies, your soul travels to the object where it remains for 1d6 days. At the end of this time, your body re-forms in an unoccupied space within 1 yard of the object. If the object is destroyed, you can replace it by purchasing a new one and performing a ritual to anchor your soul to it. The ritual takes 24 hours. If the object is destroyed while your soul is inside it, your soul descends to whatever fate your mortal existence earned.
**Immortal** You stop aging, and you remain at your present age indefinitely. You become immune to any effect that would change your age. In addition, you make Strength challenge rolls to resist attacks with 1 boon.
# Level 10
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Possession** If your soul resides in the valuable object to which it is anchored, you can attempt to possess another creature within medium range. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, your soul enters the target’s body, suppressing the host’s personality and soul. If you get a failure, the target becomes immune to your Possession talent until it completes a rest.
You control the body you possess as if it were your own. You retain your Intellect and Will scores, talents, and spells, but you otherwise use the target’s statistics in place of your normal ones. You remain in this body until your original body re-forms, at which point this effect ends. If the valuable object to which your soul was anchored is destroyed, you remain in the host’s body until it dies or is destroyed.
