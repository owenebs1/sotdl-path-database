Those who take up the path of the orb master distinguish themselves from all other spellcasters in a most obvious way. The only implement an orb master uses is a crystal ball that he or she creates from special sand imbued with magical energy. This magic orb enables its owner to exert greater control over his or her spells, shaping areas to suit their needs, creating pockets of safety within the area, or concentrating magical energy to obliterate a foe.
