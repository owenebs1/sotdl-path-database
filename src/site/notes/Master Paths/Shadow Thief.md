You lost your shadow at some point in your career and have felt its loss keenly, somehow feeling incomplete. Luckily, you learned how to steal others’ shadows and make them your own for a time. Invariably, these stolen shadows wither and die or, worse, turn against you, but your need to fill the void in your heart drives you to pilfer any shadow you can.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You discover the Shadow tradition or you learn one Shadow spell.
**Steal Shadow** If you have no shadow, you can use an action to steal the shadow from one creature you can see in an area of shadows or light within short range of you. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a success, its shadow disappears and the target never casts a shadow again, though any effect that ends a curse (as a rank 4 spell) restores its shadow. You have the target’s shadow and the shadow still has the target’s shape, but it follows you wherever you go.
While you have a target’s shadow, you learn everything the target knows and can make use of its professions and languages, though not its talents. In addition, you make attack rolls against the target with 1 boon and the target makes challenge rolls to resist your attacks with 1 bane. Finally, you can pinpoint the target’s exact location anywhere in the world. If you fail the attack roll, you lose this talent until you complete a rest.
**Shadow Decay** Each time you complete a rest, the shadow fades. Roll a d6 and record the number rolled, adding it to a number rolled previously. If the total of the numbers rolled reaches 20, the shadow disappears, taking with it any benefits you had from it, you gain 1 Corruption, and the creature to whom the shadow belongs must succeed on a Will challenge roll with 1 bane or gain Insanity equal to its Will score.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Magic** You learn one Shadow spell.
**Dueling Shadows** You can have up to two stolen shadows at a time from your Steal Shadow talent.
