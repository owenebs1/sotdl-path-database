Embracing the sheer destructiveness of magic, annihilators cast their spells with a near-suicidal recklessness. These casters favor Destruction spells, since they achieve the most direct results. But, not content with what these spells offer, annihilators learn to tap into their life reserves to cast their spells to even greater effect.
