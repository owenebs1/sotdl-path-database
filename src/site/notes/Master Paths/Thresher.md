For all their effectiveness in battle, flails demand much from their wielders. The weapons’ construction make them difficult to control and more than one student has cracked themselves upside the head when the weighted end whips back. You, though, have made it your life’s work to make yourself a master of these weapons and in your hands they become as living things. A flick of your wrist sends the weight spinning toward your foe to crash through its defenses and land a deadly hit. You sacrifice versatility by your singular focus, but few equal you in hand-to-hand fighting.
