There are places on Urth where the seas and skies behave strangely, where time and distance distort, where the waters swallow ships and crews entirely. Wise sea captains bound for distant ports set aside coin to hire the services of a mystic navigator, a member of a society of scholars who have learned how to chart a safe course through the strangest of waters.
Most mystic navigators begin their careers as sailors, mariners, navigators, and scholars of cosmology and the occult, and then go on to delve into the secrets of magic. The study of magic is never necessary to join the order, which is open to anyone who has the will o learn. All mystic navigators wear on a cord around their necks a miniature ship’s wheel made from iron or bronze.
