Students of the Order tradition find that the magic affects their minds, causing them to become rigid and inflexible. Continued study, however, can bring about other changes of a beneficial nature. As the masters of the tradition become steeped in its lore, they find their bodies growing resistant to the ravages of time and injury, as they transform into embodiments of order. The greatest legalists, as they call themselves, become fixtures in the world, eternal champions of the natural order of things.
