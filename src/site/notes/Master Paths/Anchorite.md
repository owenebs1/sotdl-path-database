Some of the devout believe that they cannot truly understand the nature of the divine unless they withdraw from the world to get away from distractions and temptations. In seclusion, they pray and meditate, fixing their minds on the infinite to better appreciate their place in the world and how best to serve their patron deity. Many anchorites utterly abandon civilization, spending the rest of their days in isolation, but a few return from the wilderness to bring to bear what they have learned to help fight the forces of darkness.
# Level 7
Attributes Increase three by 1
Characteristics Health +2, Power +1
Magic You discover one tradition or learn one spell.
Divine Withdrawal You can use an action to withdraw from the world for as long as you concentrate, up to 1 minute. While withdrawn, you rise 1 yard into the air and remain there for the duration, emitting light in a 5-yard radius. Until the effect ends, you are immune to damage, spells, and any other effect. Each time you use an action to concentrate on remaining withdrawn, you gain an epiphany that remains until you expend it, until 1 hour elapses, or until you use this talent again. When you make an attack roll or a challenge roll, you can expend an epiphany gained from this talent to make the roll with 2 boons.
You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Power score. You regain expended uses when you complete a rest.
