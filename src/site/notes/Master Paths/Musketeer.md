Musketeers focus their training on mastering swordplay and firearms to become even more effective and versatile combatants. Most musketeers belong to elite fighting forces in civilized lands, such as the fabled House Guard of Edene or the Royal Order of Musketeers who protected the rulers of the Kingdom of Sails in ancient times. Whether or not they belong to such an order, musketeers use their weaponry to great effect, baffling their enemies with finely honed exploits and maneuvers.
