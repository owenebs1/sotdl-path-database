Alienists have shattered their minds through reckless investigation into magic that no one was meant to learn. Burdened with unusual tics and tendencies toward inappropriate behavior, they tend to make others uncomfortable in their presence. In exchange for the wreckage done to their mental stability, alienists benefit from their connection to powers and forces that exist beyond the barriers of the worlds.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Madness tradition or you learn one Madness spell.
**Shards of Sanity** Your maximum Insanity score now equals your Intellect score + your Power score. Whenever you would make a challenge roll to resist gaining Insanity from learning a Madness spell, you can substitute Intellect for Will.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Blessing of the Alien Gods** Your association with forces beyond your reality has resulted in the development of a random mutation. Roll on the Mutations table (Shadow, page 198) or, if you have The Hunger in the Void, roll on the Useful Mutations table on page 19.
**Frayed Ends of Sanity** Whenever you go mad, tendrils of darkness spread out from you a number of yards equal to your Power score. The tendrils heavily obscure the area for all creatures other than you and they remain until your madness ends. The tendrils move with you. When the darkness appears and at the end of each round until this effect ends, each creature in the area must get a success on a Will challenge roll or gain 1 Insanity. Creatures do not become frightened from gaining Insanity in this way.
