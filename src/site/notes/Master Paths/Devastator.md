Able to emulate the power of the most dangerous storms, those who are called devastators bring rain, lightning, and thunder down on their enemies. Most devastators see themselves as the vengeful arm of the Old Faith and use their magic to punish those who have wronged them or intruded too far into the wilderness. Most people who have crossed paths with these wild spellcasters speak their names as curses.
