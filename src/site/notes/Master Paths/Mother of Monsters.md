You made a pact with an eldritch terror. Each night, the terror comes to you and, by way of hideous coupling with shadowy phalluses, it fills you with its seed. Thus, each dawn, you awaken with belly distended, filled with the monsters you will birth unto the world. From your befouled womb come forth terrors beyond imagining, each an abomination that has no place in reality.

**Appalling Offspring** Each time you complete a rest, your belly fills with your abominable offspring. You can use an action to take 1d6 damage and push out one of the offspring, which causes a [[small monster\|small monster]] with the horrifying trait to fall out of your body and land prone between your feet. The offspring then stands up and takes its turn, and you become dazed. You control the monster, deciding what it does on each of its turns.
The monster remains until it’s killed. At the end of each round, you can make a Will challenge roll and remove the dazed affliction from yourself on a success. Each time you use this talent, roll a d6. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number of times you have used it since your last rest, a veritable sea of foul-smelling afterbirth erupts from between your legs and paints the ground with a noxious slime that eventually dries and flakes away. Once you drop the afterbirth, you cannot use this talent again until after you complete a rest.
You can have up to three [[small monsters\|small monsters]] under your control at a time. If you would give birth to a monster beyond this limit, the oldest monster “grows up” and leaves your company to wreak havoc elsewhere.
