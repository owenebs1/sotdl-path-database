Craving power, you turned your efforts to amassing a cult-like following. You prey on the desperate, the lonely, the gullible, and downtrodden and make them your unwitting slaves. You have your hooks in them to the point that they are beyond reason, beyond hope. They do whatever you say and gladly sacrifice themselves for whatever cause you claim.

**Captivating Oratory** Outside of combat, if you speak in front of an audience, an audience member that is not hostile to you listens for the duration of your performance.
