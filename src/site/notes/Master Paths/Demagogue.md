Craving power, you turned your efforts to amassing a cult-like following. You prey on the desperate, the lonely, the gullible, and downtrodden and make them your unwitting slaves. You have your hooks in them to the point that they are beyond reason, beyond hope. They do whatever you say and gladly sacrifice themselves for whatever cause you claim.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Languages and Professions** Gain one criminal profession of your choice.
**Captivating Oratory** Outside of combat, if you speak in front of an audience, an audience member that is not hostile to you listens for the duration of your performance. Members remain for the length of your oratory, unless doing so would threaten themselves, their loved ones, or their property. Otherwise, you impose 3 banes on Perception rolls made by audience members for as long as you speak.
**Entourage** You have an entourage made up of hangers-on and sycophants. Your entourage has a number of members equal to your level. You can recruit new members and replace dead or hopelessly mad members of your entourage, up to your maximum, after you complete your current adventure.

### ATTACK OPTIONS

### SPECIAL ATTACKS
**Willing Sacrifice** When you would be attacked by a creature you can see while you are within 2 yards of a member of your entourage, but before the die is rolled, the entourage member uses a triggered action to switch the target from yourself to itself.
**Summon Angry Mob** If you are in an urban environment containing people subjected to your oratory at least once in the last seven days, you can spend 1 minute talking to such people to form into 1d3 + 1 angry mobs. The angry mobs are hostile to one or more creatures you describe to them and the mobs take the next available turn to destroy the targets of their hostility using whatever means they have. A mob might scour the town for the creatures you describe or travel up to 1 mile out of town to attack a target you choose. Once you use this talent, you must wait 24 hours before you can summon another angry mob in the same community.
