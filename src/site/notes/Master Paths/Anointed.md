Chosen by their gods, the anointed act almost as living avatars of their deities. By means of their unwavering faith, they channel divine power directly from their deity, or so they believe, and use it to advance their godâ€™s causes in the world. The first of the anointed belonged to the Order of Light, but other followers of the path have since appeared among the Cult of the New God and various sects and cults affiliated with it.
