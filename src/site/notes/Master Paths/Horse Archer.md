An ancient and effective fighting technique that has made sporadic appearances throughout the long and tangled history of RÃ»l, horse archery gives combatants a significant edge in battle, allowing for superior maneuverability that lets them loose arrows and speed away from danger. Innovated by the elves in their struggles against the trolls, it was later picked up by the Woad tribes to fight a skirmish war against the Men of Gog. Of all the peoples to master the technique, however, none have come close to the centaurs who have used the techniques to frustrate human expansion into their lands.
