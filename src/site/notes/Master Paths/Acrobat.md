Acrobats include all manner of adventuresome types, from cat burglars to performers who delight crowds with rolls, tumbles, and other acrobatic stunts. Acrobats train to master their movements, build speed, and outmaneuver their opponents. The results of all their practice is the ability to move unfettered, whether scrambling up a wall, somersaulting over an enemyâ€™s head, or moving like water across the most difficult terrain.
