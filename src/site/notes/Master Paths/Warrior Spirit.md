On the battlefield, when the screams of the dying rise above the clash of steel, when the stench of blood, shit, and death hangs heavy in the air, some find it harder to keep control and maintain their focus. Their minds fracture under the strain, and madness takes over, driving these warriors to acts of appalling violence. The jotun believe that a spirit of battle fills such warriors and lends them power. Mostly drawn from the ranks of berserkers, fighters, and juggernauts, spirit warriors embrace their madness as they shrug off their enemies’ attacks and tear their foes to pieces.
