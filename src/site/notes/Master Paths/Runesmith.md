Runesmiths uncover the secrets of creating runes and imbuing them with magical power. They typically adorn their weapons and armor with such marks, which flare with power when they cast a spell. Most runesmiths learn their techniques from the dwarfs, who it is said developed the tradition from the language of the gods.
