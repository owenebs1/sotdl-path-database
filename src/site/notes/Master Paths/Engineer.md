A career spent creating wondrous devices earns engineers their renown. The culmination of an engineer’s training is the creation of an eidolon, a mechanical servant of enormous size that obeys its maker’s commands. Engineers go to great lengths to maintain their creations and constantly make small improvements to increase their servants’ functionality.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add an academic area of knowledge.
**Eidolon** You create a construct that has a humanoid shape but can otherwise have any appearance you choose. The eidolon is 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. You can have only one eidolon at a time.
If your eidolon is destroyed, you can build a new one to replace it. Doing so requires you to work at least eight hours using parts you create or harvested from your old eidolon. At the end of this time, you have a new eidolon.
The eidolon is not alive. It is never affected by deprivation or exposure, and it ignores any effect that would age it. When incapacitated, the eidolon ceases to be a creature and becomes an object.
The eidolon is under your control. You decide what it does on each of its turns. The eidolon’s statistics follow.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Cockpit** You install a cockpit in your eidolon. The cockpit is a compartment with a Size 1 capacity and fitted with controls and a comfortable seat. Any creature of the appropriate Size can move into the cockpit if it isn’t occupied. Once inside, the creature can control it from within. While inside, you treat the construct’s Defense and Health scores as your own, move at its Speed, and can use its attack options and actions in place of your own. The cockpit has breathable air for 4 hours.
A creature inside can use an action to open the hatch, ventilate the interior, and close it to gain another 4 hours of air. A creature can leave the hatch open for as long it wishes, though the eidolon does not function while the hatch is open.
**Mighty Eidolon** Increase the eidolon’s Health by 25 and Defense by 2.
