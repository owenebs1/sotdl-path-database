Devils freely offer magic, knowledge, and power to mortals willing to sully their souls by dealing with dark forces. Diabolists exploit the devils’ willingness to bargain and forge pacts with them to work as their agents in the world, corrupting and staining mortal souls, and delivering them to Hell. Those who fail to make good on their promise are snatched from the mortal world and dragged screaming to perdition.
Those who study dark magic, who bargain with devils, or who gather in profane cults to hasten the apocalypse promised by the Demon Lord’s shadow must do their dark deeds in secret lest their activities draw the attention of witch hunters. These individuals, commonly associated with the New God’s cult, search the Empire’s lands for the corrupt. When they find the guilty, witch hunters drag them out from the shadows to face the justice their villainy earned them, which most often involves being tied to a stake and burned alive.
Serving devils in this way is an act of great evil for which there can be no redemption, only damnation.
For this reason, only the most ambitious and wicked seek out pacts with devils and use the power offered to become paragons of evil in the world until Hell comes to claim them.
