Discovering the Soul tradition was but the first step on the road to the enlightenment that all cenobites seek. After spending their lives exploring the mysteries of their inner selves and reclaiming memories from their past lives, cenobites become more than what they were born to, attaining a truly enlightened state that enables them to overcome the limits of their bodies and triumph over any challenge they might face.
