The world would still be a dangerous place if so many strange and awful creatures did not crowd its dark and unexplored places, but the abundance of these bizarre threats makes traveling through the wilderness a risky proposition. To help make safe the roads and routes across the land and sea, monster hunters offer their services and expertise.
Most monster hunters developed their talents the hard way, by venturing into regions overrun with horrible creatures that would happily tear them limb from limb. A few supplement their fighting skills with knowledge drawn from the accounts of others who survived fights with these hateful things. Regardless of how they come by their training, monster hunters are gritty survivors with the courage to stand against the horrors of the wilderness, no matter what forms they might take.
