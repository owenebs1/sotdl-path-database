The greatest users of Metal magic complete their studies when they join the ranks of the metallurgists, a society of master spellcasters. The magic they have studied becomes part of them, suffusing them with the strength of steel. Shiny gray skin and brittle hair betray the true nature of metallurgists, evidence of the effect their knowledge has had on them.
