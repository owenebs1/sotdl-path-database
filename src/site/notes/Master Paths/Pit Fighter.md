People love their sport. They gather at the arenas to watch gladiators fight wild enemies, or hapless slaves, or each other. People always clamor to see fighters squaring off in a ring, beating each other to a pulp. Of all the violent spectacles that take place, pit fighting might be the most extreme. In a pit fight, two combatants are dropped into a pitâ€”and only one is allowed to leave. Experienced pit fighters, for obvious reasons, are quite rare and are always vicious combatants.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Fight or Die** When you would take damage, you can choose to take 1d6 extra damage. For 1 minute thereafter, your weapon attacks deal 1d6 extra damage. You derive no further benefit if you take damage while you are under the effect of this talent.
**Maiming Strike** When you get a success on an attack roll made using a weapon and your attack deals extra damage from Fight or Die, you can maim the target instead of dealing the extra damage. A target maimed in this way is impaired. At the end of each round, the target can make a Will challenge roll and removes the affliction on a success.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Ghastly Injuries** A creature impaired from your use of Maiming Strike makes challenge rolls to remove the affliction with 2 banes.
**Violent Resurgence** When you heal damage, you can use a triggered action to make an attack with a melee weapon against a creature you can reach.
