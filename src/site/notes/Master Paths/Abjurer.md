Abjurers strive to master Protection magic.
Such a focus on defensive spells might result from deep-seated paranoia or bitterness over a previous violation. Most who become abjurers are naturally suspicious and discover their deeper understanding of the tradition breeds in them even greater distrust. Many abjurers go to great lengths to protect themselves. They might conceal their appearances, erase their histories, adopt different personas, or simply keep to themselves.
