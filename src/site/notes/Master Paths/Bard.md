Bards have great skill as performers, but they are no mere minstrels. Their mastery of Song magic gives them many advantages when interacting with others. They can draw from the songs and poems they learn to gain clues about the world around them, and weave magic into their music to manipulate their audiences, whether to inspire them or demoralize them. Bards are highly sought the world over for their skills and expertise, and find welcome almost anywhere they go.
