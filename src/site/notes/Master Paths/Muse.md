Faeries have an enduring interest in mortal creatures. They recognize the potential of mortals, but they pity their short life spans. A muse is a special kind of fey dedicated to helping mortals, and others, realize their capabilities, offering them inspiration and motivation to find success in what they do best. Muses tend to be elves, but can also be fauns, pixies, or any other individual who has a knack for bringing out the best in other people.
