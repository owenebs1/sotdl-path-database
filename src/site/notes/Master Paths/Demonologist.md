Demonologists look into places the sane do not dare. Into the Void go these unhinged people, drawn by promises of power, answers to the great mysteries, and escape, perhaps, from the end of all things. For some, the path of the demonologist marks the culmination of a long and sordid career. For others, it is a misstep, a temptation to which one succumbs, inevitably tumbling into a darkness from which there is no escape.
