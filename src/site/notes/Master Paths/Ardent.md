Telekinesis magic grants those who discover its power the means to affect the world around themselves with mere thoughts. They can move objects, hurl telekinetic force at their foes, and move themselves through the air. Ardents master Telekinesis magic as a way to supplement their fighting prowess. By focusing their thoughts, they can smash through any resistance they might face and deflect incoming attacks.
