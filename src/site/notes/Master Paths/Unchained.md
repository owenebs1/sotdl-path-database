The spellcasters who call themselves the unchained are able to ignore the laws of magic and wield its energy in its rawest form. They can convert the force of their spells into outbursts of destructive energy, blasting their foes to scintillating motes and warping their environments into bizarre landscapes. Theirs is a form of magic to be feared, for they recognize no constraints and revel in the havoc they create.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Chaos tradition or you learn one Chaos spell.
**Chaotic Caster** You must roll a chaos die (a d6) whenever you make an attack roll or challenge roll. You apply an odd number rolled as a penalty or an even number as a bonus to your roll. If you cast the [Chaos Boon](https://sotdl-database.vercel.app/spells/chaos/chaos-boon/) spell, you roll an additional chaos die.
**Crackling Chaos** When you cast a Chaos spell, residual energy swirls around your body until the end of the round.
Any creature that takes a turn while within 1 yard of you or that moves to within 1 yard of you must get a success on an Agility challenge roll or take damage equal to 1d6 +your Power score.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Chaos Blast** You can use an action and expend the casting of a Chaos spell to release a destructive blast of energy.
The blast can have the following shapes, all of which originate from a point in your space: a 5-yard cone, a 3-yard-radius sphere, or a 10-yard-long line. Creatures and objects in the area take damage equal to 1d6 plus 1d6 per rank of the spell whose casting you expended.
This damage ignores the spell defense trait. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll and takes half the damage on a success. Creatures incapacitated by this damage die, their bodies warped beyond recognition.
Objects destroyed by the damage are twisted into bizarre shapes. Once you use Chaos Blast, you must wait 1 minute before you can use it again.
