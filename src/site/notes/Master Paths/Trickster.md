Masters of Fey magic, tricksters use their talents to outwit and frustrate their enemies. Like the most mischievous faeries encountered in the wild, tricksters find it hard to pass up the chance to humiliate their enemies. And though their tricks are rarely lethal, their escapades can put people in serious danger.
