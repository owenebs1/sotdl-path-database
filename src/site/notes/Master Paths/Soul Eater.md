Souls have energy, useable energy as evidenced by certain forms of magic. You, though, learned another way to utilize this power; you eat it. You suck it dry from the bodies of your victims and you let the psychic screams of the disembodied spirit wash through you. The souls you consume break down inside you until they vanish, destroyed forever. That souls are an irreplaceable commodity makes no difference; you hunger and after devouring a soul the pain abates, for a time.
Eating souls marks you. Darkness rings your eyes and ink blots the sclera around your irises. Your body grows thinner as you lose interest in food and drink, and in dim light, shadows seem to form screaming faces on your skin, faces of the lives you have devoured. When you speak, the sounds of the slain edge your voice
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4, Corruption +2
**Eat Soul** When a living creature or spirit (with a Difficulty of 5 or more) within short range of you dies, you can use a triggered action and gain 1 Corruption to swallow the triggering creature’s soul. The soul emerges from the body, if it has one, as a shrieking wisp of vapor that spirals into your mouth. Swallowing a soul in this way grants you points of soul energy, which you can expend to use other talents granted by this path. A soul grants you 1d6 points of energy. Keep track of soul points gained from eating souls separate from each other.
While you have at least 1 point of a soul’s energy, you know all the languages the creature knew and gain any professions the creature had.
**Spirit Foe** You make attack rolls against spirits and spirits make attack rolls against you with 1 boon. You make rolls to interact with spirits in a social setting with 3 banes.
**Exploit Soul** When you succeed on an attack roll, you can expend 1 point of soul energy to deal 2d6 extra damage.
**Soul Casting** When you would expend a casting to cast a spell you have learned, you can expend soul energy instead of a casting. You must spend a number of soul energy points equal to 1 + the rank of the spell.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4, Corruption +2
**Release Soul** You can use an action to release a soul you have eaten. The number of points gained from the soul drops to 0 as the soul comes bursting free from your mouth, wailing. Each creature other than you within medium range must succeed on a Will challenge roll with 1 bane or gain 1 Insanity.
**Spirit Fuel** When you take a turn, you can expend 3 points of soul energy to increase the number of actions you can use on your turn by one.
