Creeping through the darkness, unseen and unheard, nightstalkers are masters of the art of stealth. Many nightstalkers use their nearly supernatural talents for criminal pursuits, whether thievery or murder. Others use their abilities to fight creatures of darkness, gathering information about them and then striking with shocking surprise.
