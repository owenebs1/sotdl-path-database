Teleportation magic allows instantaneous travel from one point to another. Travelers have studied the tradition so extensively that they can move with even greater speed and arrive with such force that they disturb their surroundings.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2, Speed +2, Power +1
**Magic** You discover the Teleportation tradition or learn one Teleportation spell.
**Hasty Escape** When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use a triggered action to expend a casting of a rank 1 or higher Teleportation spell. You teleport to an open space within a number of yards equal to 1d6 per rank of the spell whose casting you expended and then become dazed for 1 round. If the target can no longer attack you, its action is wasted.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Far Traveler** When you teleport from casting a Teleportation spell, you increase the range of the spell from short to medium, medium to long, or long to extreme.
**Spatial Disturbance** Whenever you cast a Teleportation spell, all creatures that can see you treat you as if you were in an area that is partially obscured. The effect lasts for 1 minute.
