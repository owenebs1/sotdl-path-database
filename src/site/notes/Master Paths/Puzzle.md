The methods harvesters use to prolong their lives should trouble anyone. Harvesters plunder the living for the choicest bits: organs, bones, skin, whatever they can take and graft onto their own failing flesh.
Rather than be put off by the harvesters, however, you found in them inspiration and spent no little time striving to make their techniques your own.
You have left an untold number of tangled, bloodied bodies behind you as you strove to perfect your technique, but perfect it you did and now you have adapted bits and pieces from victims to supplement your own failing organs. You have beautiful hands now, perfect eyes, a head of lustrous hair; hardly anyone notices the stitches. Ever does your eye roam the faces and forms of people you meet, though, for something better to be found in the next person you encounter.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +3, Insanity +1d6, Corruption +2
**Languages and Professions** You speak another language or gain another profession.
**Harvest Flesh** You can spend 1 minute working with a knife to harvest something from one living creature you can reach. The living creature must be restrained in some way or unconscious. When you finish, make an Intellect challenge roll. On a failure, you ruin whatever it was that you tried to harvest. On a success, you gain a +1d6 bonus to Health that diminishes by 1 each time you complete a rest or you use this talent again. The target, however, takes 1d6 damage at the end of each round. A creature with a healerâ€™s kit and that can reach it can use an action to make an Intellect challenge roll with 3 banes. On a success, the target creature stops taking damage but is permanently maimed in some awful way of your choice.
Alternatively, when you succeed on the challenge roll, you can choose to kill the target outright. When you do so, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice.
The benefit lasts until you complete a rest.
- You make Strength attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon for 24 hours.
- You make Agility attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon for 24 hours.
- You make Perception rolls with 1 boon for 24 hours.
- You gain a +4 bonus to Speed for 24 hours
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +3, Corruption +2
**Invigorating Harvest** When you use Harvest Flesh, the bonus to your Health increases to 3d6. In addition, while you have this bonus, you make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon.
Horrifying You become a patchwork creation of stolen body parts. You cannot gain Insanity. In addition, any creature that sees you must make a Will challenge roll.
On a success, the creature becomes immune to your horrifying trait until it completes a rest or, on a failure, gains 1 Insanity.
