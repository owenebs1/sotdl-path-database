The failures of the mortal soul manifest as corruption, stains that weigh down the soul after death to send it tumbling into Hell. The Cult of the New God demands that its faithful live good and noble lives, ever walking in the light lest shadow consume them.
To those known as sin-eaters, these admonitions do not go far enough. Rather than allowing souls to suffer, the sin-eaters have devised a method to draw corruption from the living and take it into themselves.
Purifying souls in this manner runs counter to the cult’s teachings, and thus other adherents of the New God consider sin-eaters dangerous and heretical.

**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +4, Power +1
**Magic** You discover one tradition or learn one spell.
**Sense Corruption** You can use an action to sense the presence of corruption around you. You know if there are any creatures within short range that have 1 Corruption or more.
**Eat Sin** You can use an action to remove Corruption from a creature you can reach. The target must have at least 1 Corruption. If the target is unwilling, the target must be defenseless, unconscious, grabbed, or immobilized, and you must get a success on a Strength or Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. Upon touching the target, you and the target become stunned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, you and the target must each make a Will challenge roll with a number of banes equal to its Corruption score. If you get a success, you reduce the target’s Corruption score by 1 (minimum 0), and you increase your Corruption score by 1. If the target gets a failure, it takes damage equal to half its Health.
