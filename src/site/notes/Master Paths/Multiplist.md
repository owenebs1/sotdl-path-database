You have discovered the means to make copies of yourself, to reproduce your body again and again and thus create an army of you. Each copy you make is, however, somewhat less than you are and as their numbers grow, you find yourself confronted by increasingly warped and hideous versions of yourself.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Personal Division** You can use an action to cause a naked and unequipped copy of yourself to wrench itself free from your body and appear in a space within your reach.
You and the copy each gain 1 Insanity. The copy uses your statistics and knows everything that you know, but it has a Health score equal to half your Health score and it cannot use Multiplist talents. You control your copy and it takes its turn separate from you. When the copy appears, roll a d6 and add to the roll the number of copies you currently have.

| 2     | No additional effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3     | Reduce the copy’s Intellect score by 1d3. If this reduction drops the score to 7 or less, the copy cannot speak.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4     | Reduce the copy’s Intellect score by 1d6. If this reduction drops the score to 7 or less, the copy cannot speak. In addition, the copy is impaired.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5     | As a 4 result, but the copy has unsettling deformities that grant it the frightening trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6     | As a 4 result, but the copy is clearly an abomination, causing retching and weeping in all who see it. This copy has the horrifying trait.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7+    | A foul, slippery mass plops out from your body to land prone on the ground in your space. It screams for a few minutes and then expires after heaving one last gurgling breath from its partial, fluid-filled lungs. Gain 1 Corruption and you and each copy that can see the mess gain 1d3 Insanity. |
**Copy Decay** Each time you complete a rest with at least one copy in existence, you must succeed on a Intellect challenge roll or gain 1 Insanity. Each of your copies must also make a Strength challenge roll and an Intellect challenge roll. On a failed Strength roll, reduce the copy’s Health by 1d6. On a failed Will roll, the copy gains 1d3 Insanity.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Absorb Copy** You can use an action to attempt to absorb one of your copies within short range of you, an act that will annihilate the copy from existence and is something that your copy does not want to have happen. Make a Will attack roll against the copy’s Will. On a success, the copy liquefies and flows into your being, causing you to heal damage equal to twice your healing rate, but you gain 1 Corruption and must succeed on a Will challenge roll or gain 1 Insanity.
