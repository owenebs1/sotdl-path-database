Zealots wander the lands as itinerant preachers and crusaders of their faith. They lead by example, depriving themselves of all the comforts of civilization in order to become closer to their gods. Often, their zeal manifests as madness, and they exhibit self-destructive behaviors to purify their thoughts.
