The line between reality and illusion blurs around illusionists. These masters of Illusion magic fabricate lifelike simulacra of creatures and intense bursts of energy, or reshape their environments to suit their needs. A great many illusionists come from the ranks of magicians, though a few began as rogues, developing their magical skills to pull off daring schemes.
