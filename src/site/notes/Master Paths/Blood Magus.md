Blood magic, an offshoot of the Necromancy tradition, originated with vampires who sought to use spells to supplement their normal methods of feeding. Their methods have since spread, as other magic-users have found ways to draw potency from the blood in their veins to empower their spells. Masters of these techniques are called blood magi. Most have bodies crisscrossed in scars, evidence of the wounds they open on themselves to enhance their magic.
