The dread forester joins the few who have made it their life’s work to protect the world’s forests. They know all there is to know about the trees, and know the proper remedies to deal with fungal infections, infestations of vermin, and other maladies that affect these plants. When their charges come under attack, the foresters direct all their wrath at the despoilers, working with the trees themselves to eradicate their foes.
