You know your body, your flesh and blood, are nothing more than a temporary vessel for your soul.
No matter how well you maintained the meat of your physical form, it will wither and die to release your essence to be erased in the Underworld or elsewhere.
This fate is one all must confront, but you have chosen a different path for your soul, one that lets you preserve your identify long after death.
You came upon the solution to your problem in anancient manuscript that you believe was penned by the warlocks of Gog. Within its pages, you discovered an incantation that unties the psychic knots that bind your soul to your body. So liberated, your soul can freely exit the body and return.
Your soul, outside of the body, becomes vulnerable, for if dispersed it will sink into Hell, a doom earned by your meddling with your fundamental nature. To prevent your soul from ever moving on, you tether it to a device, a vessel that anchors your soul to the world. So long as the vessel remains intact, you will persist indefinitely.
Existence as a disembodied spirit denies you the pleasures of the flesh and thus you have learned to possess other creatures, to suppress their own souls and take their bodies for yourself. You jump from body to body, switching out when you grow weary of one form to seek out another, more interesting host.
Even if you die while inside the stolen form, your soul returns to your vessel and you can set out to find another worthy host.
# Disembodied Soul Traits

Apply all of the following traits to your character.
- **Attributes** You do not have a Strength score. You cannot physically interact with objects, creatures, or your environment. You are immune to any attack or effect that would target your Strength score or that can be resisted with a success on a Strength challenge roll.
- **Characteristics** Increase your Perception score by 2.
	Reduce your Health score by the Strength score you had when you died. Recalculate your healing rate based on this new score. Finally, discard your Insanity score.
	You are no longer at risk of gaining Insanity as you are already mad.
- **Frightening** A creature that does not have the frightening or horrifying trait must make a Will challenge roll when it first sees you. The creature makes the roll with 1 bane if it sees four or more frightening creatures at the same time. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened for a number or rounds equal to 1d3 + its Insanity total.
	Once a creature makes this roll, it becomes immune to your frightening trait until it completes a rest. Members of your group that get a success on the challenge roll become permanently immune to your frightening trait.
- **Darksight** You can see in areas obscured by shadows and darkness within medium range as if those areas were lit.
	Beyond this distance, you treat darkness as shadows and shadows as lit.
- **Immune** damage from cold, disease, fire, and poison; asleep, blinded, deafened, diseased, fatigued, immobilized, poisoned, slowed.
- **Insubstantial** You take half damage from weapons. You ignore the effects of moving across difficult terrain and you can move through solid objects and other creatures.
- **Naturally Invisible** You are invisible to all creatures other than spirits, animals, and children. While invisible, you lose the frightening trait and you cannot use actions or triggered actions to attack.
- **Manifestation** You can use an action to remove your Naturally Invisible trait, which causes you to become visible. You can use an action to end this effect.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Power +1, Corruption +1
**Magic** You discover one tradition or you learn one spell from a tradition you have already discovered.
**Soul Vessel** You have a soul vessel, which is a specially-prepared container, such as a jar, urn, or box. The container is a Size 1/8 object with Defense 5 and Health 20. If destroyed, your soul immediately descends through the Underworld and falls into Hell.
The vessel houses your soul. If you are not under the effects of your Possession talent, your soul must remain within short range of your soul vessel. If at the end of any round your soul is beyond short range from your vessel and you are not possessing another creature, your soul immediately returns to your soul vessel and cannot leave it for 1d6 rounds.
Possession You can use an action to attempt to possess one creature within short range of you or your soul vessel. You can target a creature whose Difficulty is 100 or less. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Will. On a failure, the target becomes immune to your use of **Possession** until it completes a rest. On a success, your soul moves into the target’s body and remains there until you move out of it or the target becomes Incapacitated, at which point you move into an open space within 1 yard of the target.
While inside the target’s body, you replace its Intellect and Will scores with your own, but you otherwise use the target’s game statistics in place of your own. The target cannot take actions, move, or perceive anything. You can call upon the target’s memories as if they were your own.
