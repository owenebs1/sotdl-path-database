Those who take up the path of the librarian surround themselves with books, scrolls, and other writings, delving into these works to gain a greater understanding of the world and its nature. Their research inevitably reveals to
them knowledge of magic and spells, and librarians keep the spells they learn in their books for easy recall when needed.
No librarian goes anywhere without at least a few books in his or her backpack.

**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover a tradition or you learn one spell.
**Personal Library** You have three tomes filled with secret lore.
For each tome, choose one area of scholarship. When you would make a challenge roll to recall information related to an area of scholarship associated with one of these tomes, you make the roll with 2 boons. If you lose a tome, you can replace it for free after you finish your current adventure.
In addition, each tome contains one spell of your choice.
You can select these spells from any tradition, even traditions you have not yet discovered, but each spell must be of a rank you can cast. If you choose a spell from a dark magic tradition, you gain Corruption as if you had learned the spell. Finally, if at some later time you learn a spell contained in one of your tomes, you can replace the duplicate spell in your tome with a different one, subject to the normal rules for filling your tomes with spells.
**Tome Casting** If you are holding one of your tomes, you can cast a spell it contains by expending the casting of a spell of the same or a higher rank.
