The mages of the tower are a secretive society based in the Tower Arcane that floats above Caecras. Known for the colorful clothing that completely conceals their appearance, they are devoted to the study of magic and the advancement of their understanding and capabilities. Mages of the Tower Arcane do not reveal the inner workings of their organization to outsiders, and add to their numbers with great reluctance only when necessary.
