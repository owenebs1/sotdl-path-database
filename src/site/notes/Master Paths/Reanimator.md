Until now, without divine intervention or the use of potent magic, death punctuates the existence of living things. Many have sought solutions to the limits of mortality; though most have found partial answers in magic, a few keen minds have put science to the task. The most notorious of these scientists are reanimators. They have found a way to triumph over death, after a fashion, but so far no body restored to a state close to unlife has ever managed to revive the soul that once dwelled within the flesh.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2; Corruption +1
**Languages and Professions** Add the science academic area of scholarship to your list of professions.
**Elixir of Reanimation** You can concoct a special elixir that reanimates the dead. When you gain this talent, you start with 1 dose. You can create additional doses by spending 1 hour with an alchemist’s kit to brew the substance from 1 gc worth of exotic materials. When you finish, you create 1d3 + 1 doses of the elixer.
You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to apply one dose of the elixir to one target dead creature that has a humanoid shape. After 1d3 rounds, the target becomes a [[Bestiary/Reanimated Corpse\|Reanimated Corpse]] of its size. If the target was an immortal, such as a faerie, the target returns to life, gains Insanity equal to its Will score and goes mad, suffering the violence result. The violence lasts until the creature is killed.
>**Violence.** Hate overwhelms you. Until the madness ends, you must take a fast turn each round and use an action to attack the creature nearest to you, regardless of whether it is a friend or a foe. At the end of each round, roll a d6. A roll of 5 or higher ends the madness.

Upon creating a reanimated corpse, you must make a Will attack roll against its Will to establish control.
On a success, the target becomes compelled until you complete a rest. Once every 8 hours, you can use an action to establish control over a reanimated corpse you created but do not currently control. An uncontrolled reanimated corpse is hostile to all creatures that are not reanimated corpses.
**Restorative Infusion** You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to expend a dose of your elixir of reanimation on one target reanimated corpse within reach.
If the target is compelled by you, it must succeed on a Strength challenge roll or gain the Explosive trait (which is described below), deals 1d6 extra damage with its attacks for 1 round, and heals damage equal to its healing rate at the end of the round.
If the target is not compelled by you, it must succeed on a Will challenge roll with 1 bane or become compelled by you until it’s destroyed.
