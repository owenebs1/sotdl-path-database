Until now, without divine intervention or the use of potent magic, death punctuates the existence of living things. Many have sought solutions to the limits of mortality; though most have found partial answers in magic, a few keen minds have put science to the task. The most notorious of these scientists are reanimators. They have found a way to triumph over death, after a fashion, but so far no body restored to a state close to unlife has ever managed to revive the soul that once dwelled within the flesh.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2; Corruption +1
**Languages and Professions** Add the science academic area of scholarship to your list of professions.
**Elixir of Reanimation** You can concoct a special elixir that reanimates the dead. When you gain this talent, you start with 1 dose. You can create additional doses by spending 1 hour with an alchemist’s kit to brew the substance from 1 gc worth of exotic materials. When you finish, you create 1d3 + 1 doses of the elixer.
You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to apply one dose of the elixir to one target dead creature that has a humanoid shape. After 1d3 rounds, the target becomes a reanimated corpse of its size. If the target was an immortal, such as a faerie, the target returns to life, gains Insanity equal to its Will score and goes mad, suffering the violence result (Shadow, page 35). The violence lasts until the creature is killed.
Upon creating a reanimated corpse, you must make a Will attack roll against its Will to establish control.
On a success, the target becomes compelled until you complete a rest. Once every 8 hours, you can use an action to establish control over a reanimated corpse you created but do not currently control. An uncontrolled reanimated corpse is hostile to all creatures that are not reanimated corpses.
**Restorative Infusion** You can use an action, or a triggered action on your turn, to expend a dose of your elixir of reanimation on one target reanimated corpse within reach.
If the target is compelled by you, it must succeed on a Strength challenge roll or gain the Explosive trait (which is described below), deals 1d6 extra damage with its attacks for 1 round, and heals damage equal to its healing rate at the end of the round.
If the target is not compelled by you, it must succeed on a Will challenge roll with 1 bane or become compelled by you until it’s destroyed.
