For months, the Great Mother has visited you in your dreams and made available to you a teat on which you have suckled. Having drunk deep of the divine milk, you find your body has grown larger, tougher, your claws lengthening until they’ve become as sharp and imposing as swords. You join a rare society of devoted servants of the monstrous goddess and become an engorged brute.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Size +1, Health +12
**Brutal Digger** You gain the Long Claws trait (See below).
If you have this trait already, your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 extra damage.
**Tunneler** You can move up to your Speed through earth, sand, or material of similar consistency. You leave behind a 1-yard-diameter tunnel behind you as you move this way.

Your claws lengthen. Now, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + 2 damage.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +12
**Mother’s Milk** You can use an action to spew divine milk into the mouth of one willing creature within reach. The target heals damage equal to twice its healing rate and becomes impaired for 1 minute. At the end of each round the target is impaired in this way, the target can make a Will challenge roll. On a success, the target removes the impaired affliction from itself. You can use this talent three times. You regain expended uses after you finish a rest.
**Rampaging Brute** If you take 5 damage or more, you can use a triggered action to move up to half your Speed. Each creature you can reach at the start of this movement, during this movement, and when your movement ends makes an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 damage. Once you use this talent, you lose access to it for 1 minute.
