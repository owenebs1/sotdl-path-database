Dust walkers learn their techniques from the mad genies of the Desolation’s deep wastes by discovering their names and harnessing their power. The knowledge they gain destabilizes dust walkers’ minds, making them as willful and ruinous as their crazed patrons. Some pursue this path to heal the land, while others seize it to grow their own power.

**Dust Storm** You can use an action to turn into a cloud of swirling dust and move up to your Speed. While in this form, you are immune to damage, can move through spaces occupied by other creatures, and can move through openings wide enough to permit the passage of air. This movement does not trigger free attacks. When you finish moving, you resume your normal form, and each sighted creature within 2 yards of you must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or become blinded for 1 round. You can use this talent a number of times equal to 1 + your Power score. You regain expended uses when you complete a rest.
