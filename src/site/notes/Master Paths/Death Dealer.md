Death dealers favor heavy, cumbersome weapons for the carnage they can create. Whether they are hefting a weighty warhammer or sweeping with a greatsword, their swings and strikes send limbs flying as they carve a bloody swath through their enemies. The great strength required to wield these weapons typically means death dealers come from martial backgrounds, likely beginning their careers as warriors or battle-focused priests.
