Changelings walk many different paths to find their fate in the world, and many go on to become great users of magic, mighty warriors, or cunning scoundrels. Some changelings, however, take a different path, looking within to determine who they should become. Tapping into the magic that granted their existence, they learn to harness its power to use their abilities to greater effect, until they can become almost anyone they encounter.
