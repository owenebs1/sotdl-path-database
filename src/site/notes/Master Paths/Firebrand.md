Masters of elemental fire can produce flame and shape it into a variety of forms, bind genies to it, or burn to ash anything that gets in their way. Where pyromancers take a measured approach toward mastering Fire magic, the casters known as firebrands revel in flameâ€™s destructive properties, and as a result can be far more dangerous.

**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Fire tradition or you learn one Fire spell.
**Flaming Body** When you cast a Fire spell, you can choose to cause flames to envelop your body for a number of rounds equal to your Power score. The flames emit light in a 5-yard radius and turn darkness within 10 yards of the light into shadows. In addition, when a creature within 1 yard of you makes a melee attack against you and gets a success on the attack roll, the creature takes 1d6 damage from the flames.
While you are under the effect of Flaming Body, you can use a triggered action when you cast a Fire attack spell to end the effect early. If you do so, the Fire spell you cast deals 1d6 extra damage.
