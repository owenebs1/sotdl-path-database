When death comes to call, few people find the will to cling to life. Survivors, however, have refused death’s advances in the past and are determined to push on no matter how terrible their injuries. A survivor might have come back from a near drowning, withstood the blackest magic, or repelled the claws and teeth of a dreadful beast: whatever a survivor’s story, the common thread is that each stood up to death and said no.
