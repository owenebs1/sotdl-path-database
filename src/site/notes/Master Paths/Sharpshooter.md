Sharpshooters master the use of bows and crossbows. Their keen eyes and steady hands let them loose missile after missile with pinpoint accuracy. If they take even more time to line up their shots, they can thread their missiles through the narrowest gaps. Sharpshooters have few rivals when it comes to fighting with their favored weapons.
