Scholars of magic and the occult understand that studying certain magical traditions can trigger changes in students, altering their essential natures to make them more like the forces they wield. Elemental traditions, such as Geomancy and Aeromancy, influence their users more than others, as the magicians become attuned to the elemental forces. This is true for anyone who studies such magic, but especially for those of an elemental nature.
Your association with air magic allows you to transform yourself into a person-shaped entity of semisolid air. When you grasp the magic, your body sheds its coloration and substance so that you can fly, batter foes with powerful gusts, and slip through the smallest cracks to get wherever you wish to go.
