For too long have the faeries meddled with mortal affairs. They steal mortal children for unspeakable ends. They steal, cause mischief, and spread suffering among those who live on their borders. From the faeries come terrible curses, the loss of sanity, livelihood, and loved ones. Darkness might blight the lands, but faeries have always been forces for chaos and wickedness. You have chosen to end their reign of terror and remove their blight from the mortal world.
