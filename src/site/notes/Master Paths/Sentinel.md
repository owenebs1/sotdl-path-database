Superior senses and a strong sense of duty grant sentinels supernatural detection abilities. Little escapes their attentionâ€”not even the gods can take them by surprise. Many sentinels develop their talents by guarding important people, relics, and places. They can come from religious, magical, or martial backgrounds.
