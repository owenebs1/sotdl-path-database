Masters of Storm magic, stormbringers wield the power of the tempest, hurling bolts of lightning, deafening thunder, and the elements themselves against any standing in their way. Many stormbringers develop their techniques as devotees of the Old Faith, though they are common among magicians seeking power over the elements as well.
