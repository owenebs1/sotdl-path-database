Conjuration magic is most often used to create magical servants to do the spellcasterâ€™s bidding or to manufacture items the caster might need.
Builders, in contrast, use their magic to reshape their environments, to transform the world to suit their needs. By using the energy embedded in their Conjuration spells, a builder can construct walls, seal off passages, or fortify a position.
