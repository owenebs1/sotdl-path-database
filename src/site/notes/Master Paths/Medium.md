Mediums commune with the spirits of the dead and often catch glimpses of such spirits in peripheral vision. From these disembodied entities, mediums learn many great and terrible things. A medium could be a shaman, intimate with spirit magic, or might have come upon Spiritualism as a result of a brush with death.
