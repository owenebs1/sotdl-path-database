Rejecting the trappings of civilization, reavers come screaming out of the wilderness, armed with a fearlessness that lets them face any foe, no matter how large or terrible.
Those following the reaver path embrace the wild side, becoming savage, deadly, and eager to greet foes with violence. A reaver might have been a bold warrior, cunning thief, or devout priest, but in all cases, a reaver follows a wilder, bloodier, and far more violent path.
