The most reliable spells belong to the Arcana tradition, and for that reason many spellcasters use this tradition as the foundation for their magic. Spellmasters undertake extensive study of the tradition, then use their knowledge to enhance the other spells they cast and to make better use of the less powerful Arcana spells they have learned.
