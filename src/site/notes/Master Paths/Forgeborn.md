The magic of the Metal tradition has a lasting effect on those who access its power. Many students of Metal magic find their bodies changing, assuming a metallic sheen that eventually hardens to protect them. Others, such as the forgeborn, take greater advantage of this change and learn to shape their appendages into useful forms so that they never need fear of being disarmed.
