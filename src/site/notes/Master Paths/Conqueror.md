Conjuration magic produces objects and creatures from nothing. Conjurers learn special techniques to let them create more powerful and frightening monsters to do their bidding. Although conjurers decide what forms their monsters take, many prefer common themes. Their monsters might have tentacles, display feathers, steam the air, or have bizarre anatomical structures.
