The Death tradition is the magic of the grave, the cold of the Underworld, and its spells exist to abbreviate the lives of the living. Entropists find something in Death magic they believe will give them power. An entropist might seek to somehow stave off the inevitable, to gain favor from Father Death, or to do the dark god’s work by snuffing out life after life.

The field lasts for 1 round, and it moves with you to remain in the same position relative to you. When a living creature other than you in the sphere takes damage, it takes 1d6 extra damage. A creature can take this extra damage only once per round.
