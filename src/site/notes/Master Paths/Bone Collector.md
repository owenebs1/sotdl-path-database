Most students of the Necromancy tradition use their magic to create undead, near-mindless minions that obey their every command. Bone collectors focus their work and research on the bones of the dead, imbuing them with a form of magical life and using these servants to protect themselves from those who would interfere with their work. Bone collectors keep the bones of at least one dead creature always within reach, woven into their clothing, tied to their equipment, or carried in bags.
