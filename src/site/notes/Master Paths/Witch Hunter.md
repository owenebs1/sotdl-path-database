Those who study dark magic, who bargain with devils, or who gather in profane cults to hasten the apocalypse promised by the Demon Lord’s shadow must do their dark deeds in secret lest their activities draw the attention of witch hunters. These individuals, commonly associated with the New God’s cult, search the Empire’s lands for the corrupt. When they find the guilty, witch hunters drag them out from the shadows to face the justice their villainy earned them, which most often involves being tied to a stake and burned alive.
A great many witch hunters choose this path to do good in the world. They safeguard innocents from the depredations of bad people. A few, however, have other, darker reasons. They might be little better than bounty hunters, putting their talents to use tracking down and capturing notorious magic-users who have crossed the influential and powerful. Others have become so twisted by their faith that they see anyone who subscribes to a different religious belief as their enemy and round up initiates of the Old Faith, witches, and magicians along with the cultists and devil-sworn, making no distinction between them.
Most witch hunters work with or for inquisitors, acting with the full authority of the temple. Others are freelancers who drift from place to place, listening for rumors and watching for the telltale signs of corruption in the body and the mind.
