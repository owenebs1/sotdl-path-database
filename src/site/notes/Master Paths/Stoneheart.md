Elemental magic tends to alter those who discover its techniques, causing casters to gradually assume certain physical characteristics of the element they learn to control. In the case of those who take up the path of the stoneheart, the transformation is far more profound. Their use of Earth magic slowly petrifies stonehearts, causing them to become living statues.
