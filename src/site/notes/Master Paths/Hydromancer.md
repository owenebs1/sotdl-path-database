Developing their bond to water genies allows hydromancers to cast Water spells to greater effect and to gain greater benefits from their connections. Studying the tradition reveals its potential in battle, both in the effects its spells create and the subtle transformations they make. Most hydromancers have nautical backgrounds or spent considerable time on or under the ocean.
