Destruction magic is one of the most dangerous traditions since its spells tax anyone who casts them, causing bruises to appear on the flesh and wounds to split open. Mastering this magic helps destroyers cast Destruction spells without risk to themselves by focusing the damaging energies on a place outside of their bodies.
