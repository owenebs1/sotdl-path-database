Spellsingers incorporate their singing into the casting of their spells, enabling them to create magical effects without needing to wield an implement and to reach more distant targets using the sound of their voices.
Almost all spellsingers were talented in both singing and spellcasting prior to choosing this path, and likely concentrated their studies on Song magic.
