More than anyone, namers know there is great power in names, power that gives them ultimate authority over the being or thing named. Some began their careers as scholars, researchers into forbidden things, while others happened upon these words of power, discovering the secret language of the cosmos.
The ones who turn their attentions fully to the apprehension and mastery of names become namers, masters of the lexicon.
Namers know several true names, having researched them for specific purposes such as
defense, information, and to serve as their agents.
Most namers learn, right away, to use their knowledge with caution, as naming creatures can create powerful enemies.
