Psychokinetics discover how to harness the mind to manipulate and move objects and creatures with thought alone. Rooted firmly in Telekinesis magic, psychokinetics use their thoughts as weapons and their imagination to gird themselves against harm. Many psychokinetics come from combat-focused backgrounds. They draw on their memories of conflict to focus their thoughts into effective attacks.
