Dark magic appeals to a scant few, and is almost never taken up by those who would fight the darkness creeping across the world. Yet, some believe that the best weapon to use against evil is evil itself. These people are practitioners of the Forbidden tradition, debased and degenerate souls that have been tempted by the promise of power, who now bring to bear the fullness of their dread knowledge to turn back the forces that would end all things. The methods they use are not for the faint of heart, for they are grim, disgusting, and despicable.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Forbidden tradition or you learn one Forbidden spell.
**Appalling Abasement** Rather than sacrifice a creature to dark powers to regain the castings of your Forbidden spells, you can perform an act of utter and foul depravity that might include just yourself or others as you see fit. The act should take at least 1 hour to perform. In addition, if you gain 1 Corruption or more, you neither need to sacrifice a creature or perform an appalling act to regain expended castings of your Forbidden spells. You simply regain them for a number of rests equal to your Corruption score.
**Self-Sacrifice** When you cast a Forbidden spell, you can choose to take 1d6 damage per rank of the spell to make the attack roll with 3 boons or impose 3 banes on the challenge roll made to resist the spell.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Icon of Darkness** Each time you cast a Forbidden spell, darkness swirls around and heavily obscures you for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s rank + 1. You can see normally through this darkness. If you are already benefiting from this effect when you cast a Forbidden spell, add the spell’s rank + 1 to the duration of this effect.
**Spells of Suffering** When you cast a Forbidden attack spell and get a success on the attack roll, the target of your attack is also fatigued for 1 round.
