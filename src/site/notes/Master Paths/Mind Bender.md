Unlocking the door that releases a flood of telepathic power is the first step mind benders take to being able to shatter the minds of other creatures. Telepathy magic gives mind benders the ability to bash down a creature’s mental defenses and run freely through its mind, sensing its every thought and anticipating its every action.
