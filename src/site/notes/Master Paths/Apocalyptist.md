The power Forbidden magic offers lures many students of magic to their doom. Apocalyptists delve deep into the dark tradition, heedless of the steep price to their bodies and souls. No good can come from Forbidden magic, so nearly all apocalyptists are figures of staggering evil, dedicated to advancing vile causes in the world. They revel in the horrors their corruption creates.
