Executioners elevate killing to an art form. An extensive study of anatomy reveals how best to make their attacks so that every strike is potentially devastating, strong enough to lay low the mightiest foes. Although many executioners start their training as assassins, others take this path after being headsmen, torturers, or devotees of bizarre death cults. Executioners, regardless of their backgrounds, prefer dark clothing and black hoods to conceal their features.
