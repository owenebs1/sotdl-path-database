All who study Celestial magic look to the heavens for answers to the mysteries of reality, but it is the dawnstriders who peer at the sun, blinding themselves with its purifying radiance. By burning out their eyes, dawnstriders gain the ability to see using another form of light and perceive the world through their own inner radiance. Dawnstriders often identify themselves by covering their eyes with a white blindfold that has a red sunburst symbol at the center.
