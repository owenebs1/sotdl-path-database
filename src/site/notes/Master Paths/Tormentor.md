True terrors on the battlefield, tormentors thrive on filling their enemies with fear and loathing, eroding their courage and sending them fleeing from them. Most tormentors achieve their objective of domination by making threats against those nearest to them and by making their foes suffer before dispatching them. Many festoon their bodies with the skulls of fallen foes, daub their bodies with blood and excrement, and do whatever else they see fit to enhance their frightening appearance.
