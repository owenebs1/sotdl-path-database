Defenders develop combat skills to protect the people around them and to withstand the attacks they take on their companionsâ€™ behalf. Once drawn into a fight, defenders take positions in the front to lock down their opponents. Since they take the greatest risks, defenders prefer heavy armor and usually carry shields.
