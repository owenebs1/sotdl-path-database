Master spies, infiltrators can find ways into the most secure locations. They use a combination of disguise, acting, and instinct to outwit security. Even when spotted, they fail to make a lasting impressionâ€”people have a hard time remembering that they ever saw them. And should their ruse be exposed, infiltrators know how to slip away from their pursuers unscathed.
