Invocation magic places a strain on the minds and bodies of those who call upon its power, since each casting transforms the caster so that he or she assumes a daemon’s likeness and gains a measure of its abilities.
Daemonhosts have become so accustomed to the binding of daemons that they find their bodies open and accepting of these essences, adapting easily to the spell’s demands and thus able to make use of the daemon’s powers more easily.
