All forms of magic can wreak havoc on the world. Spells themselves bend and twist reality to suit their casters’ purposes, after all. But Time magic presents a special danger, in that its reckless use can create paradoxes—logical contradictions that cause reality to reorder itself, often with disastrous consequences. For this reason, certain masters of Time magic dedicate themselves to preserving time as it is and heading off efforts to change the past and thereby alter the present. Called chrononauts, these keepers of time travel stand watchful for any sign of the misuse of their tradition. And when they find evidence of such, they move quickly to resolve the paradox before its effects can be felt.
