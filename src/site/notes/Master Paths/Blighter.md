Blighters are believed to be responsible for the Desolation’s present form. At one time, these magic-users were counted among the mightiest of the Witch-King’s servants. They drained the land of life to raise armies of the dead, constructed magnificent monuments to themselves and their master, and loosed destructive power against their enemies. The blighters’ techniques yet await those ambitious and hardy souls willing and able to pry them from the Desolation’s ruins.
Blighters exploit the world’s resources, destroying life to feed their ambition. Thus, this path appeals to students of the dark arts, the reckless, and the insane.
