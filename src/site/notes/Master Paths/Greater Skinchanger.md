With time and effort, skinchangers can overcome the curse they carry, so that it becomes part of them. This mastery rids them of their loss of control in the full moonâ€™s light and prevents them from passing on the curse to others. Making peace with the beast within allows them to combine the might of both forms to become something greater.
