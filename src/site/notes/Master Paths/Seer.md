Some are born with a gift of special sight, able to see the doom that awaits others. This can be an unbearable burden, and some people born with the gift go so far as to gouge out their eyes so they never again see the flesh melt from their friends’ faces or worms writhing in their eye sockets. Others come to see these visions as blessings from the Dark Gods and accept them as their fate. All seers are a little crazy, a trait that manifests in twitches and nonsensical utterances. Seers can pronounce what they believe to be the fates of creatures around them, uttering profound words that can embolden or terrify. The most powerful of their kind can even drive off the Valkyrie, reminding them that the time for a warrior’s death is not yet at hand.

**Characteristics** Health +3, Power +1
**Magic** You discover the Divination tradition or you learn one Divination spell.
**Pronounce Doom** You can use an action to expend the casting of a spell. Choose one creature within medium range. If the creature can hear and understand you, it must make a Will challenge roll. On a success, the creature makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened.

**Not Your Time to Die** When a creature within medium range would become incapacitated, you can use a triggered action to cause that creature to heal damage equal to its healing rate.

On a 6, you make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 boon for 1 round.
