Tree shepherds protect primeval forests and woodlands from the axes and flames of trespassers.
Staunch enemies of any who would despoil nature, they can awaken the forests they protect, stirring the trees to fight at their sides. The magic that tree shepherds wield, however, transforms them, causing them to forsake their flesh-and-blood bodies to become more like the woods they guard.
