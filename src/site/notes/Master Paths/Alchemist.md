Many study Alchemy, learning the secrets of substances to create potent concoctions, potions, and other strange, materials, but true alchemists stand apart thanks to their discovery of the deeper mysteries of the occult art. As proof of their superior alchemical training, alchemists keep company with the tiny servants they fashion from a bit of clay and their own blood. These homunculi are the ultimate helpers, since they know all their creators know.
