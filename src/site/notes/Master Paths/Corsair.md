Nimble combatants that rely as much on their wits as they do on weapons, corsairs master trickery to confound their opponents. Corsairs know how to use maneuvers to create openings in defenses and use those openings to deliver punishing wounds. When corsairs see the battle turn against them, they have the dexterity they need to escape to fight another day.
