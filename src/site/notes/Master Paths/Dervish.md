Although anyone can fight with two weapons, dervishes make two-weapon fighting look easy. Quick and nimble, they dance across the battlefield, weapons moving faster than the eye can follow. Dervishes are so good at what they do that they can wield weapons of equal length in each hand, keeping one of those weapons at the ready to knock aside incoming attacks.
