There are few trades as disreputable as the manufacture of poisons, so poisoners rarely display honor or virtue in their dealings with others. Commanding extensive knowledge of all things toxic, they can produce the deadliest poisons to deal with almost any kind of creature. Poisoners always have some sort of toxin on hand to protect them when justice comes for them.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1
**Characteristics** Health +2
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession.
**Poison Mastery** You can use an action and an alchemist’s kit to create a dose of poison (see Chapter 6 for details). You must spend at least 1 minute concentrating, during which time you use the kit and special ingredients worth 5 cp.
Creatures make Strength challenge rolls with 3 banes to resist poisons you create and take 3d6 extra damage from your poisons.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Poisonous Touch** You can use an action or triggered action to attack one target creature you can reach with a needle hidden in a ring or on the tip of your finger.
Make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. On a success, the target takes 1 damage plus 2d6 extra damage from the poison on the needle. A target that takes the extra damage must get a success on a Strength challenge roll or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, it is also dazed and slowed. If the target is already poisoned in this way, it takes 3d6 extra damage. At the end of each round, a target poisoned in this way must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, it takes 1d6 extra damage.
Once you deal damage with Poisonous Touch, you cannot use the talent again until after you spend 1 minute working with an alchemist’s kit to prepare another needle.
