Students of the Illusion tradition can use their spells to transform their environments, to conceal dangers or invent new ones by weaving threads of magical energy into whatever forms they wish. Those who master the tradition and in doing so find ways to make their illusory creations even more dangerous are called phantasmists. The creatures they create are more ferocious, and the spectral flames they wield burn even hotter, all for the sake of making their illusions more lifelike and thus more threatening.
