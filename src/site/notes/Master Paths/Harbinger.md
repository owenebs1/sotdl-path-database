The elusive and mysterious harbingers pour out from the realms of faerie to raid mortal lands, speeding ahead of the main host to prepare the way to victory. Harbingers use the hidden passageways that crisscross the world to strike from the least expected directions and then melt away before their foes can mount a defense. Any faerie might pursue this path, though pixies are best suited to it.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Increase three by 1 each
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a faerie profession.
**Ghost Strike** You can use an action to cause an image of yourself to appear in an open space within short range. Make an attack with a weapon as if you were in that space. On a success, you deal damage as normal and then teleport to that space.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +4
**Swift Escape** When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use a triggered action to make an Intellect challenge roll. On a success, you teleport to an open space you can see within short range, and if the target could no longer attack you in your new position, its action is wasted. On a failure, you lose this talent until you complete a rest.
