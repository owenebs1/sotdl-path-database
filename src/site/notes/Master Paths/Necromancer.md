What waits for all mortals beyond death is a subject of great interest and ensures that the various religions have a steady supply of followers seeking meaning and purpose in this world. For the necromancer, the answer to this mystery lies within the dark arts of Necromancy. Mastering its secrets can overcome deathâ€™s grip and provide unspeakable power over life and death. Necromancers are shunned the world over, feared for their willingness to peer into the darkest places and consort with forbidden things best left undisturbed.
