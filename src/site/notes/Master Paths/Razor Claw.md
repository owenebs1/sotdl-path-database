Whether you had claws or gain them upon taking this master path, you prefer to use them over just about any other melee weapon. You keep your claws nice and sharp so you can flense the skin from your victims’ bodies. And, since the claws are part of your body, you can swipe with great speed and precision.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose two attributes and increase both by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Claws** Your unarmed strikes become natural weapons (claws) that deal 1d6 + 3 damage and retain their normal properties. In addition, when you attack with your claws and the total of your attack roll is 20 or higher, your claws deal 1d6 extra damage and cause the target to become impaired for 1 round. At level 10, the target instead becomes impaired for 1 minute.
**Springing Strike** When you use an action to attack, you can jump a distance equal to half your Speed before or after you make the attack roll. If you jump first, you make your attack roll with 1 boon. If you jump after, your movement doesn’t trigger a free attack.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +5
**Rapid Claw** When you get a success on an attack roll to attack with your claw, you can use a triggered action to make an attack with your claw against the same or different target. Once you use this talent, you have to wait until you can use it again. During the end of the round, you can roll a d6 and on a 4 or higher, you can use this talent again.
**Cut through Anything** Your claws can tear through stone and metal. When you make an attack roll to attack with your claws, you can make the roll against the lower of the target’s Defense or Agility.
