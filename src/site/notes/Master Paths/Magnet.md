You study the magnetic fields surrounding metal objects and from your exploration of Metal magic, you discover how to manipulate them through natural means, without having to use magical energy to shape and shift them. Your abilities change you, though. Some people feel sickened in your presence, while others find the hairs on their bodies standing up. Iron fillings and similar objects of the same size and composition might slide toward you of their own accord.
