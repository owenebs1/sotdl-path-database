Aeromancers strengthen the bond they forge with wind genies to coax even greater power from the beings.
A consequence of their increased connection is the restlessness in the air around them. Their clothes and hair are never still. A breeze always stirs the dust around them, scattering unsecured papers and causing unprotected flames to flicker and dance.
