The dwarfs developed the forgehammer techniques In an effort to improve arms and armor used in their near constant fighting against those who would plunder their mountain homes. The best smiths received invitations to join a secret society of magic-using dwarfs who had developed magical seals they could place on weapons and armor. Membership demanded creating exquisite items of priceless quality and, on approval, the artisan gained permission to craft a forgehammer, a magical tool and weapon used to place the mystic seals on dwarfen arms.
Having earned esteem for your metalworking, you received an invitation from the forgehammers and earned your place among their ranks after demonstrating your incredible talents. The forgehammers have opened their society to trustworthy members of any ancestry, as the time for secrets has long since passed thanks to the growing darkness in the world.
# Level 7
**Attributes** Choose three attributes and increase each by 1.
**Characteristics** Health +2, Power +1
**Languages and Professions** You speak another language or add armorer, blacksmith, or weaponsmith to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Rune tradition or you learn one Rune spell.
**Forgehammer** You created a forgehammer, a mighty magical weapon and tool needed to make use of your other talents. The forgehammer counts as a Warhammer without the cumbersome property.
**Forgehammer Seals** You can use an action to strike one weapon or suit of armor with your forgehammer and grant it one of the following seals. You can have a number of active seals equal to your Power score. If you place a seal in excess of your maximum the oldest seal you placed fades away.
- **Seal of Balance.** The seal grants 1 boon on attack rolls made with the weapon.
- **Seal of Might.** Attacks with the weapon deal 1d6 extra damage.
- **Seal of Burrowing.** Whenever you roll a 20 or higher on an attack roll made using the weapon bearing this seal, the weapon breaks off and burrows into the target’s body, dealing 1d6 damage to it at the end of each round. A target that heals any damage ends the effect and the shards fall to the ground.
- **Seal of Seeking.** The weapon’s range increases by one step, from short to medium, medium to long, and so on. In addition, attacks with the weapon ignore the effects of concealment and all but total cover.
- **Seal of Hardness.** A weapon doubles its Health, while armor reduces the wearer’s damage from weapon attacks by 1d6 for each attack.
- **Seal of Secrets.** Attacks with a weapon bearing with this seal make no sound and so long as the weapon is carried or worn, it is invisible to all creatures other than the creature wearing or carrying it. Armor bearing the seal silences the wearer’s footsteps and renders the wearer invisible until the wearer uses an action to attack or cast a spell, at which point the armor loses this property for 1 minute.
- **Seal of Speed.** Armor bearing this seal gains a +2 bonus to Speed.
- **Seal of Protection.** Armor bearing this seal grants a +1 bonus to Defense.
