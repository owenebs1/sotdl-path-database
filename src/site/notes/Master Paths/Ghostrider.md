Ghoststriders walk the gaps between the mortal world and the spirit world, as comfortable in one realm as they are in the other. Their long association with spirits enables ghostsriders to bind them more easily and to greater effect. Most ghoststriders have extensive tattoos on their bodies as a show of reverence for the spirits they have learned to bind.
