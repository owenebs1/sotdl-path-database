Anyone can be in charge of a ship, but sea captains stand apart from the others thanks to their extensive experience and natural talent. When a sea captain takes control, everything onboard seems to fit into place, almost as if the captain had become an integral part of the vessel. The crew works harder, the ship sails faster and seems to navigate dangerous waters more nimbly than before. For this reason, crews gravitate toward notable sea captains, who give them the best chance to survive a life at sea.
