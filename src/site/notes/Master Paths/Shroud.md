Unnerving figures all, shrouds are masters of the dark art of Death magic. Wherever a shroud goes, death follows. Flowers wilt, ordinary plants wither, the sick get sicker, and the dying expire. Many shrouds serve Father Death, becoming his avatars in the world.
Others have no such allegiance; they simply exult in their ability to extinguish a victimâ€™s final spark of life.
