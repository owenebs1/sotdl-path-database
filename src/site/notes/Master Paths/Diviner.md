Divination lays bare the future and makes it possible to look and listen at distant places. Diviners have a gift for Divination magic, a knack possibly born from a latent psychic ability or being touched by the gods. As they explore the power the tradition offers, they learn how to cast their spells to greater effect. More important, they receive visions about the future and can use those visions to escape danger or to achieve success when they would otherwise fail.

**Premonitions** Each time you complete a rest, you receive three premonitions. For each, roll a d20 and note the result. The premonitions last until you expend them or you complete another rest.
When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or challenge roll, you can swap the number rolled with a number from one of your premonitions by expending it. Once you expend the premonition, cross out the number.
While you have at least one premonition, you cannot be surprised while conscious, creatures attacking you make attack rolls with 1 bane, and you make challenge rolls to resist attacks with 1 boon.
