Having vowed to protect the land, woodwoses call upon power from the natural world to carry out their obligations. Woodwoses lose much of the appearance gained from their ancestries, becoming more plantlike over time. Their skin becomes like bark, their eyes shine with emerald light, and new leaves sprout across their bodies.
