Within many living beings resides a soul, the essence that transcends life and death, and thus allows mortals to experience many lives and immortals to live indefinitely. Some who seek to understand the magic of the Soul tradition find themselves transcending their earlier limitations and becoming able to do things that were previously unthinkable.
Others use the magic to secure their souls against anything that would harm them and to anchor them to the world so that they never need fear death again.
These latter few are dubbed the eternals, named such because so strong is their control over their own souls that not even Father Death can lay claim to them.

**Languages and Professions** You can speak another language or add a profession to your list of professions.
**Magic** You discover the Soul tradition or you learn one Soul spell.
**Immortal** You stop aging, and you remain at your present age indefinitely. You become immune to any effect that would change your age. In addition, you make Strength challenge rolls to resist attacks with 1 boon.
**Unsullied Soul** You impose 2 banes on all attack rolls made against your Intellect or Will, and you make Intellect and Will challenge rolls to resist attacks with 2 boons.
In addition, if you are charmed, compelled, dazed, or frightened at the end of any round, you can make a Will challenge roll and remove the affliction on a success.
# Level 10
**Characteristics** Health +3
**Magic** You learn one spell.
**Eternal Soul** When you would make an attack roll or a challenge roll using an attribute other than Will, you can use Will in place of that attribute.
**Triumph over Death** You no longer need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, though you can do so if you choose.
If you die, you can choose to return to life 1d3 rounds later. At the end of this time, you become alive again, heal damage equal to your healing rate, and take a –5 penalty to your Health. If the penalty would drop your Health to 0, you cannot return to life. If you die while you have this penalty and then return to life, the penalty worsens by –5.
Each time you complete a rest, you lessen the penalty by 1 until it reaches 0.
